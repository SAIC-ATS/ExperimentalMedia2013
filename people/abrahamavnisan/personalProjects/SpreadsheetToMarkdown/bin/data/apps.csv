I was born in Moscow, Russia.  My practice is organizational and curatorial : in Toronto I run a number of organizations that explore alternative approaches to image making, production, and consumption. I am interested in subverting traditional templates within the art system.  I enjoy nature and physical challenge. Once I biked from Toronto to Montreal with a dog.","In my practice, i often crowd source to fill in the gaps or as the focus of a project. I have had several projects involving large group of people that are activated by participation. In a way, part of my work as artist-curator involves the construction of an alternate reality occupied by the artists and art projects that i become involved with. my work in publications and performance is often extremely collaborative, and I am a member of a number of loose collectives.","One example of a collaborative practice is my project Rearviews: a review is reviewed and that review is reviewed again by a string of people, like an exquisite corpse or a broken telephone. this eventually constitutes a publication. In the broken string of reviews are narrative that evolve between the reviewers, and which ultimately require collaborative support. In this project, people reveal themselves as tending to engage in a joined narrative that connects them as characters, not reviewers.","I the summers of 2012 and 2011 I have spent a while in a local residency started by my friends and i called Don Blanche. In this residency, we would execute a number of art projects - some sculpture, some performance, some installation. we also built a sauna and a hot tub from scratch, and made a beach by ordering a lot of sand. everyone lived on cots in tents or in one big dorm and share space and meals. the residency would have between 18-40 people in it at any given time, it would last for 2 weeks.","i am interested in improvised delivery of projects , which seems inevitable in the hike scenario. I like that it involves movement of both time and space, conceptually, this is interesting to me. I am also looking forward to becoming inspired by the mobility and physical activity involved - its refreshing to have a summit or a conference in a mobile format. ","something i would be interested in is the subject of score - through looking at a number of film/musical scores from hitchcock to john cage, I would be very interested in talking about the visual representation and importance of the score,  as not only a document but a map. I would also be interested in having a micro reading group - where we discuss a short text impromptu, while walking, cooking or what have you,",,"what do you hope to take from this experience?
I am hoping to meet people. that are different or  like minded, to see new approaches to presentation/ workshoopping, to learn some new things and to teach somethings to others, and to maybe have some new ideas.",,residency unlimited,none

It is exciting for me when I end up with something completely unexpected. I rarely consider any part of my process as a mistake, because in the end, no matter where I go, I have learned and explored something new. Being fully immersed in a community that leaves room for progressive discovery has taught me that the only way to make work is to make work. Period. No matter how seemingly “chaotic” my process gets, my soul is so deeply rooted in a need to have my hands on materials that I cannot stop creating. 
I recently completed my final semester at Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design, and I am eager to break away from institutional ideals.","In order to create art, I begin my process by entering into a meditative space, creating small places of order in my studio. Evaluating natural commonalities between these small places, I begin to develop an idea, and then move into the act of editing and clarifying the idea. Said created order can be built alone or collectively. Both approaches are always moving forward, naturally moving into an idea. Editing and clarifying the idea is best done collectively, with many different perspectives from others. Upon clarifying created ideas, work is made. I am always eager to collaborate, our realities depending fully on others.","In unifying found objects by color, I strive to set up a scenario that leaves room for my audience to confront their own obsessions with materialism. The Blasphemy Project seeks to address the problematic ways in which culture encourages people to interact. Materials become the means by which we communicate, becoming a substitute for one to one sincere communication of our emotions. Through objects we jump to conclusions about identity, rather than slowly engaging with the newness of the other. In short, objects become proxies for others and control our experiences with others.
My work is tangible in order to be confrontational. I work to coerce viewers to regard everyday objects in a new light. In this body of work, I am taking objects laden with feminine expectations, altering them into a silhouette of color, and re appropriating them into a substitution for women. The pink I use has a similar level of energy as a bright red, but is less aggressive. In popular media, pink is a color associated with women. In painting these bright pink objects they become a tongue in cheek representation of themselves, amplifying their feminine nature to an even higher level.

http://gracemcmicken.tumblr.com/ ",I have not experienced a living experience this unique yet in my life. I am eager to experience connection on this level.,"In my current practice, I have always had a kind of power struggle with my instructors. I want thinkers and collaborators to be able to completely open themselves up to connection, without restraint in regards to hierarchical ""roles"". These roles are made up and set up boundaries between student and instructor, and I wish to break through these boundaries to enter into genuine, open connection and insight. I see this as a fantastic opportunity to do so.
I am drawn to the Unthinking/Unknowing program as a means to separate myself from the act of thinking in order to enter into meditative creation.",NA,,"Why is dating so superficial these days?

",Session A (BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE // RECONSTRUCTING WILDNESS),"I was born in 1954 to a family of Yoruba wood carvers called AJIBOGUNDE in the western part of Nigeria, Ogbomoso.  I had my elementary and part of my secondary education in Ghana, between 1966 and 1969.  I came to Nigeria in 1970 to further my secondary and tertiary education. I am currently a painting lecturer in the department of art, design and printing technology, The Polytechnic, Ibadan Oyo State, Nigeria.  I bagged my first degree in Painting from The Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria in 1985 and a master’s degree in African studies (visual art) from The University of  Ibadan in 1991, Ph.D in Art History from The Commonwealth Open University, British Virgin Islands, U.K.  in 2013. I was the pioneer art teacher at the Local Authority Teachers College, Osogbo, before I joined the Polytechnic, where I am now a Senior Principal lecturer of painting and Art History. I was made a justice of Peace of Oyo State in 2000.
Between 1999 and 2001, 2007, 2009-12, I was the Head of Department. In 2006, I participated in art workshop in Egypt and in 2006 was artist in residence at Air Le Parc, Pampellon, France.

",https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5MDPYlfsdMAdm91TjlUX3VvS2c/edit?usp=sharing,Hike (A SUMMIT ON A SUMMIT),"I am an artist living and working in Brooklyn, NY.  My background is in sculpture and I really enjoy learning about building and fabrication.  For the past 8 years I have worked two dimensionally and the last three years specifically in painting and printmaking.  For the past five years I also worked as the Director of a non-profit arts organization in NYC and now work as a freelance grant writer and consultant for artists and organizations.  I am also an avid cyclist and take long rides upstate as much as possible.  I have a penchant for American History and read a lot of books on various topics of war, Native Americans, slavery and the psychology of killing (as it relates to war and ritual). ","I rely on collaboration in various ways, but primarily through having a wide range of people through my studio for visits where we talk about art, painting, my paintings and many other things, sometimes only indirectly related to art.  The people who participate in studio visits range from artists, curators, galleriest and collectors to writers, musicians, and non-artists.  I have collaborated in the past in a more traditional sense that involved equal input on creative and aesthetic fronts.  Also, because painting can be a relatively solitary practice, I have side projects I work on making zines and collaborating in a variety of ways using the zine format as the basis for development. ","In 2009 I collaborated with artist Heather Willems for an outdoor project hosted by Art In Odd Places, NYC.  Together we built more than 60 individual letters of the alphabet (50 inches tall) as soft sculptures that were paraded down 14th Street by volunteers and then arranged to spell several different empowering phrases once we reached Union Square.  If was a fun project and got more interesting when the public wanted to join in and start spelling their own phrases and words.  Below is a website we set up for the project and a link to an interview we did at Union Square.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGR75T24M8","Art related communal living experiences would include the 3 residency programs I've participated in.  Each was very different in the way they were set up and how much interaction was encouraged in each, but in all three the relationships I built during my time there was important and continue today.  I really enjoy and benefit from communal environments, but usually due to work, studio and other obligations I dont have much time to devote to nurturing those types of relationships/environments for myself.  I would welcome the opportunity to meet new people, learn and share about things and have provocative conversations.  I get along easily with others and am generally flexible and have the ability to adapt to new situations well.","I think that completing a 50 mile hike with a group of interesting people I've never met will be a fun challenge.  I'm interested in what I may find along the way, in terms of new things, things I can learn about myself and about others. I think its important to change your environment from time to time and that a disruption in a routine can make room for new things in interesting ways.  I deliberately instigate disruptions for myself, however this experience would give me less control over the situation (who is there,where we are, what we're doing)  and that interests me. ","My initial thought for a project of this nature, and something dear to me that I could share with a group would be that I could host an ongoing ""storytelling"" event throughout the hike.


 I have read an extensive amount on the history of New York City, the whaling industry in the U.S.and the ship wreck of the ESSEX (the story the Moby Dick is written about), abolitionists, the Gold Rush, and much more.  I find specific stories related to these topics reveal an intimacy and connection that remove some of the distance between our contemporary selves and the ancestors that created that history.  They are also incredibly fascinating stories!  I would probably select a story for each night of the hike and research the topics in order to put together a concise story to tell.  Each story could be organized in to a category to be considered, i.e. ""The 9 Levels of Hell"" (Dante's Inferno) or ""The 5 Hindrances"" (Buddhist thought).

I am hardworking and inquisitive. I swim in the ocean when it’s cold outside. I am buoyant and carry a strong optimism. I look to wonder and possibility. I like to wake up early, early enough, just before the sun gets up because then it is like we are getting up together. I open the curtains and observe the beginning. I like to get outside first thing, check in with the air; most often I do this by bike. I grew up in Watsonville, CA at the bottom of the Santa Cruz Mountains, across from raspberry fields. I moved south as an adolescent and back up north to Olympia for university at The Evergreen State College. This is where I really started to develop my relationship to thinking and making, thinking as a making. Now I live in Oakland, CA where I share house with my partner and 6 other people; I rent and share studio space in Chinatown. My studio is a thinking room. I go here to collect my experiences and perceptions and turn them into questions or remarks. My day jobs are on either sides of Chinatown at a coffee warehouse facility and a farmers market. These places all form a constellation that is my sanctuary.","I see my way of thinking and making as collaborative. Not only in the kinds of art that I am producing but also in how I think about what art is. I think about art as something whose value is found in process or in the making. The work that is interesting for me to make is that which is experience oriented or that which exists in the direct engagement of someone with the work. Often times when I am constructing something, I am thinking about a conversation that I want to have and the work becomes the prelude to that conversation as well as evidence of it. Through my practice, I begin to make a trail that weaves in and out of objects and experiences, out of sitting and reading, to drawing and teaching. The practice that I have is kind of like thinking because it is never really over, it is an exploration; it is inquisitive. ","I recently went to Iceland. I wanted to go to a very isolated place to investigate if you can experience a landscape paying attention to you or if you can only experience a landscape paying attention to itself. This question developed in tandem with a fascination for ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response). Most causes of this sensation are mundane: whispering, chewing, getting a haircut, unpredictable movement, etc. and produce an intense tingling sensation in the back of the neck, on the head, and other places on the body. The sensation is distinctly non-sexual. People are experiencing intense pleasure from watching and engaging in activities where nothing really happens. It is not about the action that is taking place but what state of attention these mundane actions have to offer. There seems to be an underlying practice of empathy that this kind of engagement has to offer. I am drawn to this community that has formed around participation in nothing and I would like to explore what else there is to learn from it.I have been making a series of experiments based on my Iceland adventure and ASMR research. I created a performance in which someone sits down at a table, puts on headphones and is then guided through peeling and cutting a potato. I sit across from them and watch.","I currently live in house with my partner, 6 other people, and Shasta, the dog. All of us are in our mid-twenties to early thirties and are social justice, direct service oriented. We have a big backyard with three raised garden beds. Kevin and I grow a variety of vegetables for the house. We all share food and upkeep responsibilities. We cook for each other and we gather once a month for a meeting. We don’t have a lot of firm cooking/cleaning structures but we all respect the space and each other and our house reflects that. Since moving here 6 months ago, I have really enjoyed the sense of support and care that comes with sharing a living space. At times, I have also found it challenging to live in a social environment where sometimes have to compromise time alone. Ultimately, I feel so lucky to share the space I do with this group of people and for how I continue to grow through the experience. ","The question “How can one make thinking?” is one that drives my practice. At this time in my life, I find that I explore this question and I mostly explore it alone. Since returning to SF Bay Area, I have built a strong community and yet I have struggled to find people who engage in making as a practice of thinking like I do. A lot of the people, artists among them that I have built strong alliances with here, are more material driven in their work.  This has been an ongoing challenge for me because of how much I enjoy the exploration and collaborative engagement that comes from discussion and work that is defined by its nature of being unfinished. I largely focus on making thinking and ways of knowing visible and I would strongly benefit from looking at unmaking thinking and making unthinking, etc.
I am also really drawn to where both teachers-in-residence, Benjamin Korta and Danièle Bourque, are coming from, specifically their respective relationships to Zen and spiritual care. Attention and awareness have been strong guiding principles in my work and I would be interested in working with people whose work is founded in these concepts.
",,"I would take the work that I have been doing with the ocean and explore it in the context of unthinking/unknowing with the other residents. I would have us all go to the ocean for 2 days and run a series of exercises to practice making the sound of the ocean at different points along the shore; presumably different sounds for different places. At each place we would gather a part of the ocean to bring back with us to the residence. There, we would place our large samples of Atlantic Ocean into big, quiet freezers. When the ocean will have frozen, we would set the different samples in a large room on the floor and sing the sound of the different ocean homes that we had learned from our practice, slowly the sea water would melt and the performers would come to face each other making their respective sounds of the ocean.","At what point is the ocean not the ocean?

2/11/2014 15:23:34,Catalina,Barroso-Luque,catabalu@gmail.com,2036910613,Catalina Barroso Luque,USA,"New Haven, CT ",28 Dec 1988,www.catalinabarrosoluque.com/works,http://catalinabarrosoluque.com/home/about/,Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING),"I am a Mexican artist living and working in New Haven, Connecticut. I received my BA in Fine Art from London Central Saint Martins College of Art & Design.

Although my practice is irrefutably linked to photography, it embraces the sculptural. At its core lies a preoccupation for the photograph’s conflictive nature as both a body in space and an image’s carrier. Moreover, within my work there is always the aim to further understand how information is structured, specifically within visual and physical frameworks, and how we maneuver our way through these information systems. I am interested in the role memory and culture play in our reading of both images and objects, and art production’s relation to this as a gradual reshuffling of cultural forms through their strategic re-use and transformation.

My work has been previously exhibited in several exhibitions throughout London, such as ""Rare Gifts"" at The Residence Gallery (London, 2012), ""TRACE"" at Frameless Gallery (London, 2012), “Inhabited (Flatfile) at Artspace (New Haven, 2013) and “Digital Ground” at Ely Slade House for Contemporary art (New Haven, 2013).etc.  In 2011 her work was shortlisted for the BARTUR Award in Photography, and was also shortlisted for the Zeitgeist Open 2012. . Last May I was awarded the Artspace New Haven 2013 Year-long Residency My work has also be featured in Fan the Fire Magazine’s July 2013 issue, Studio Magazine’s Winter 2013 Edition, in the Hartford Courant, amongst others. My work is currently being exhibited as part of Artspace NH’s Crown St Window Project (Feb-March ’14) as well as a within four month project at the Young Men’s Institute (New Haven, CT). Additionally I am now working on curating a show for the YMI’S Gallery, which will open this May.
","Intellectually my practice is fed by the contemporary art flux and is influence by its context. I find that maintaining a dialogue about my ideas related to my work is key to my thought structuring process. Conversations makeup the intellectual feeding and testing ground for my ideas/projects. Thus, I try to have regular studio visits and I have a weekly skype session with another artist with whom I have collaborated on various joint projects. 

I have previously collaborated and shared authorship over larger works and in curating exhibitions. Ei: with Isabelle Gressel, I created the Unhomely Project. This work consisted of a public domestic environment using temporary donations of personal home items and functioned as an art installation.

Likewise, part of my practice seeks to question who is the audience and what is their role, implicating others directly within my work. Ei: In The Postcard Project, people close to me with whom I’ve share an experience, receive (without any prior notice) a post-card with an snapshot of the event, shaping the work and becoming the work’s primary audience. Meanwhile those external to the work must rely solely on the description of the project and their imagination, functioning as a secondary audience. 

Similarly, I am currently working on curating a show that will be the end result of an postal art project titled “Por Oaxaca”. Here I have sent a selection artists from different backgrounds/countries a photograph and asked them to respond to the image without any further instructions or information on the photograph. My aim is to question my role as an author of a piece, while incorporating various narrative voices, and question how cultural and social factors affect our reading of a culturally loaded image. Only the artworks produced by the participant artist will be displayed within the exhibition. 

","My current series in progress would very much represent the thought, research, and making process that take place within my practice. This series, titled Maroon Bells and Paradise, plays with fragmenting photography’s materiality, both physical and/or digital. The series is composed of a set of photograms made-up of downloaded, pixilated, and recomposed landscape photographs from notable photographers. In these there is a use of abundant texture and image distortion meant as strategies of reappraising the history of landscape composition, while confronting the viewer with a screen that allows no visual progression into it. Its aim is very much to place the viewer in a state of already knowing (having encountered images in this state of decomposition, as much a landscape images prior to this) conscious or unconsciously, and unknowing given that he can’t make any logical sense of what the image is as a whole. Given that he is presented with a screen of information that contains no given structure to order the viewing experience. 

The series aims to play with shared images (abundant in our contemporary media society) and strategies of appropriation. It would also address the contemporary erosion of visual data, contesting the relationship between digital and analogue manipulation. Likewise it looks into the visual and physical frameworks that structure our engagement with reality. 

My aims to question the false utopia of access and commonality advertized by contemporary image media. The paradox of the digital and image era is that it ultimately denies us any entry, visual or tactile, into the universe of screens that compose it. We are constantly in a state of knowing/unknowing. The series spotlights our shallow visual reading skills and our contemporary understanding of reality based on a myriad of images in which we have no real presence
","Besides having lived with multiple flat-mates and going to summer camp as a kid, was going to boarding school as a teenager was the most intense experience and condensed communal living experience. I went to a co-ed school, where dormitories were male/female only, but we could invite boys over to our ‘living room’. In addition, I had to share my bedroom and the dormitory had communal bathrooms. This meant that we spent all day with a closed group of people sharing every moment from breakfast to afterschool sports, and even field trips to the local cinema. Although the experience was intense, it was very rewarding. I made some long-term friendships there and became much more tolerant and flexible towards others personalities, needs, and beliefs. Furthermore living and going to class with the same group of people benefited my learning process, my friends were more open to discuss school topics as dinner conversations and help out each other in areas one was falling behind. Boarding school became a stepping-stone in my coming of age, helping me gain some independence from family life and shaping myself as an individual within a social context. ","I feel the need to reconsider my processes in relation to my artistic concerns, and how they are understood in and across different social, artistic and intellectual contexts. Being in a collaborative environment with artists across disciplines would open my artistic horizons. The arising conversations will provide a testing ground for my ideas and spur my practice forward.
Being in such an environment would force me to re-appraise my innate structured thinking and creating logic that seeks to order and accommodate an incessant amount of thoughts. Although I am mentally flexible and can adapt to variety of thinking environments, having a mixture of lecture, physical-psychological exercises, creative and collaborative time will allow me to gain a perspective on my own work which unattainable to me at the moment. 

Moreover, the concept of unthinking/unknowing, in relation to that of entry and being held at bay by art as well as an understanding of emptiness and totality (infinite) at one point being equivalent, have been and are prevalent through out my practice. 
",,"I would produce one of the immersive image-environment installations that I have been recently planning. This would be composed of self-standing wooden walls, laid out overlapping each other. These would be placed in the middle of the gallery, emphasizing the work’s sculptural nature and allowing the audience to both walk between the panels and stand back to see the work as a one whole composition. The installation would address the visual and physical frameworks that structure our engagement with space, exploring how art historical notions like perspective and the picturesque have been carried forward through the prevalence of contemporary image-media. 
Likewise, I’ve been thinking of having an image/s printed on curtains. The images would be representations of either landscape or architecture, blown up to almost a 1.1 ratio. Within our contemporary media we constantly engage with ‘image milieus’ where we have no real physical presence – a constant interplay between entry and referral. Printing on curtains would allow the audience to walk through the image, seemingly entering it, while paradoxically emphasizing the surface nature of images. The audience would thus engage on a physical level with the image, spotlighting the images’ dependence on a medium/body and their screen-like presence. 
","What is a good, note-worthy question to ask and answer? Unfortunately no good question can be given one straightforward answer, at least within my personal thought process. Answers are dependent of the context, the depth of the response, as much as the person answering subjectivity and cultural, socio-economic background. As an artist I enjoy asking unanswerable, hypothetical or rhetoric questions. Questions where multiple answers would be fitting. ",,artslant,"garlic, butter & cream"
2/14/2014 21:40:17,David,Custodio,DaveJCustodio@gmail.com,203-521-1061,david custodio,United States,Boston,04/03/90,www.davecustodio.com,http://www.davecustodio.com/cv.html,Session A (BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE // RECONSTRUCTING WILDNESS),"I am a natural creative.  Since I was a kid I have been fascinated with playing with materials and drawing.  I take great joy in the sense of accomplishment and confidence that I get from making and seeing my ideas come into fruition.  it was in my teens that I took on the identity as an artist.  Since then I have been working with clay making functional pottery that feels like it has purpose in the world.  i also work with wood and make mixed media paintings and collages.  I find that i feel most comfortable in the company of other creative people.  When friends and i collaborate we form strong bonds and are able to prosper in a special way.  I sincerely hope that the activity of making art, which brings me so much joy, can also serve others and be positive and useful contribution to the world.","I find that though one person can accomplish much on his or her own, it is almost incomparable to the abilities of a group working together.  While I push myself in my own mediums and ideas, time and maturity has taught me that an individual is always susceptible to lack of foresight and tunnel vision.  Others can always offer counter opinions and different perspectives.  Not to mention that others will be able to fill in the gaps of another's knowledge and skill set.  With this in mind I actively pursue collaborators.  Also the nature of working with materials small and large scale requires a crew like mentality.  A hand is always needed for my work, and a hand is always ready to be lent for others.","I would say that my recent work with clay forms that interact with plants would represent me as an artist fit for your program.  I think this for two reasons in particular.  First is that this work is very much derived from nature.  Clay as a material is derived from the earth and conveys the beauty and chaotic order of the natural world.  And the second reason pertains to their concepts, all of which deal with the artist working in unison with nature.    One series of clay objects was four orbs that are cultivating succulents and presenting them in interesting ways.  Another is a series of terrariums that bring bits of nature into an interior space and are presented stylistically as if the housed moss or plant had a unique personality.  Another, is a sub-irrigated planter that waters plants through a cotton wick from a well below the soil.  Projects I would do in your residency would be ones more feasible to do on site such as drawing/painting or woodcarvings, but I would do them in the same vein as these works in clay.
     It seems that residents in your program use their interactions with nature to think abstractly.  i am very interested in doing this, as well as interacting with others interested in the same thing.

http://www.davecustodio.com/ceramics.html","My current living and working situation is an artist collective of sorts.  It is a group of like minded individuals who each has their own skills and ideas to bring to the table.  though it is often hard to deal with clashing egos, we are always determined to find common ground with each other.  With persistent mutual respect, honesty, and support, it seems that we create a kind of magic together.","I often contemplate issues of nature vs. nurture.  I think about what can be said of our true selves.  Is it something that lies in our instincts that we are born with?  are the values and practices that are cultured within us derived from truth or are they deviations from such?  are we moving towards disharmony with nature? or are we functioning in our own natural fashion even if it is expressed destructively or in a synthetic way?  A course on reconstructing wildness reads to me as a course in getting in touch with one's primitive roots.  I feel that I attempt this in my own work.  Being immersed in an environment that is conducive to this process, with others who are looking to do the same, will bring us closer to understanding these issues.","I feel that my specialties lie in materials.  I know that the woodland catskills are fertile with a variety of interesting materials that are untouched by the human ego.  If given the lead of a workshop I would challenge my peers to use and interact with found materials in their natural state.  How can we harmonize ourselves with natural order using the material that comes from the trees, the ground, rocks, the animals, etc?  This could be similar to what our ancestors did, or something new and personal.  In what ways are the materials that are organic and not synthesized different from man made ones that we interact with everyday and all the time?  What feelings do they evoke?  We can present crafted items, performances, etc.  we can also have discussions about the social implications of these materials and what that says about our own human nature.
  These are things that I think about in my own work and it would be of interest to me to involve others in this conversation.","It would have to be something large scale and structural.  I often create art that exists within a space, but more and more i think about the space as being the art.  I would build something that would coexist with the natural environment and fit within it aesthetically.  Ive done work with a post and beam builder in the past, and to me, it is a kind of structural ideal.  The wood is an environmentally friendly material and post and beam is simple, strong, and beautiful.  I could see myself constructing a post and beam structure that the viewer can interact with by actually being inside.  It could be large enough to fit within and small enough to be intimate and able to be made in a timely manner.","How can we find meaning in a meaningless world?

I make sound, sculptural and musical artworks. In addition to being an artist, I work as a librarian. For as long as I can remember,  I have always wanted to be an artist. My father was a hobby painter.  I grew up in a semi-rural small town in Ontario Canada. Being outside and close to nature has always been important to me. I like camping and hiking. I also like cooking, traveling, drinking beer in pubs, drinking wine at friend's places, drinking coffee in cafes, watching movies with my wife, going for walks with my daughter, walking my dog, reading, listening to music, listening to music loud in my living room and dancing with my wife and daughter (the dog doesn't understand dancing). I like all kinds of music. I like all kinds of art. I think art and music are of the greatest and most hopeful things that people can do, which is why I keep doing it. ","I have been involved with a few collaborative projects, particularly with making music.  I find collaborative experiences to be very generative and rewarding. The more sculptural work that I am doing now is not highly collaborative but there are elements: I prefer to work in an group/social studio space and have colleagues around to discuss ideas, art and the world around us. I find my ideas develop when I've been talking about them. When I am working on a major project, I likewise prefer to have  people around me to give input (and a helping hand) and this always ends up influencing the art I make. I do have one fully collaborative project that I am involved with currently, which is an extension of a project started ten years ago. A friend and I started making noise-music together with a freeform, totally improvised, process driven approach. Back then we were next door neighbours, now we live on different continents and the project is based on trying to maintain this  improvised approach through technology.","The Pink Glass Swans was the noise band that I started with a friend mentioned above. Our  goal was to work within a very minimal framework to allow for, as much as possible, a totally free-improvised sound at the borders of noise and music. This was achieved through an agreed upon process, which had the effect of stopping any discussion of what we were making and to focus only making in the moment and only communicating through making. The framework was represented by the situation: a medium sized room containing a robust array of sound intoning objects and amplifying devices ranging from the conventional (guitars), the novel (kids toys), the quotidian (pots and pans), and the specialized (electronic effects processors); a routine- meeting every week at around the same time for about the same amount of time; and a way of documenting (usually a cassette recorder). The process followed a set of “rules”: anyone can make this music, any object that can be used to make sound can be used, nothing is decided beforehand, listen and respond to what you hear, and play it loud.  We invited people to joins us, some regulars others only once or twice, and what happened was everyone present just started, either clapping or strumming or banging or turning on and off a radio and then for the next few hours the sound would build in waves as patterns developed and dissolved, and as people freely moved around the room picking something up or plugging something in and playing it until something urged them to change. The recording was an important part of the “noise jam” and often we would listen to the entire recording right away in order to reflect on what was made. At the time of this project I was influenced by free jazz, and in particular the political ideals of anarchy and freedom embodied in the music, and also the spiritual aspects of the music. The Pink Glass Swans project was for me one of the most influential artmaking experiences of my life.  http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Glass+Swans","As part of travelling, my wife and I have volunteered on farms (through the WWOOF organization). One such experience in Italy had about ten of us living together in one barn/loft, eating large communal meals and working together in the fields. We were there for two weeks. It was all organized by the host so we didn't have to plan much, just how to be together. We had a wonderful time. I also think of sharing studio space as a type of communal living, which I have been doing on and off for ten years or so. 
","I do not know how the hike will aid my artistic development, which is why I like the idea. I do know that I find it productive to walk and think, also I find it beneficial to go and come back.  I like the doing aspect of this hike-  planning, traveling, walking, talking, meeting new people- a departure, which at this time is something I am seeking, but not just any trip, I am seeking something which brings a dedicated focus to thinking about my art practice and discussing/experiencing it with other likeminded seekers in hopes of finding something new, something yet unthought of. I will bring a portable audio recorder with me and these recordings could potentially be the basis of a new artwork.
Reconstructing Wildness has a similar appeal, however I'm imagining this departure will lead to a very different part of the woods.  Part of my attraction to noise is the wildness of it; the way you can submerge yourself in it, lose yourself in it. This is a rare experience. I am very interested in exploring self-transcendence in different ways and connecting it to ideas of wildness is very intriguing. Religious experience and expression has been a long time interest of mine and I have been recently been thinking about transcendence, especially in relation to religious practices which focus on mind-body-self connection. I have experimented with meditation, yoga and chakra opening to limited degrees, as I always find a disconnect between these established practices and the modern world. The complexity and contradiction of seeking spirituality within modernity has recently been influencing my art. I think there is a connection with this line of thinking and the direction proposed for Reconstructing Wildness.","Following R. Murray Schafer, who developed many of the ideas of what is known as acoustic ecology, I will lead a workshop on structured listening. This will involve a brief talk on acoustic ecology, reading a bit of Schafer's writing and then proceeding as a group to follow some of the listening exercises designed by him. The most well known of Schafer's exercise is the sound walk, which is a focused listening of an environment experienced by moving through it, and is often followed up with a discussion of what was heard. ","I envision a SMT session in immersive sound and listening. One aspect would be noise making- setting up a situation for free improvisation with musical instruments and other sound making devices and amplifiers and microphones. Also listening workshops like sound walks, as described above. Another aspect could be something influenced by sound therapy and how sound vibration is used in healing- creating immersive sound environments/situations for the purpose of immersive listening, but also to work with participant's practices, such as creating sound for a performance, or sound to go with painting. ","What are a few things influencing your thoughts and art making recently?  Installation artist Mike Nelson, composer Terry Riley, Tibetan Buddhism, psychedelia, the 1970s, aesthetics, Godzilla movies, listening to my music collection on random,  J. G. Ballard short stories, early abstract  painting, walking through the city.","There is nothing as far as scheduling conflicts, however I may wish to schedule a departure mid way through to meet with my wife and daughter, or they could come visit me. My daughter is one and half years old and I would find three weeks to be a long time to be away from my family.",Online through searching for art residencies (but I forget which website in particular) or the instant coffee listserv,"I do not have any specific restrictions or allergies but as much as possible I prefer to eat whole foods, naturally/organically raised, no preservatives... that kind of thing."

This year I want to draw/write some comics, but I also have a bunch of performances lined up. 
I am pretty focused on making art these days, but I also have to deal with surviving capitalism, systematic oppression, etc.  and that can cut into my creative energies. I'd like to be able to cut off these concerns for a few weeks, hang out with smarty pants art folk and soak in the wilderness at the Yellow House.  
","I have been doing various media projects with queer folks: coordinating the Slippery Slope Cabaret, hosting a radio show/ interviewing trans*artists and activists, and engaging in the youtube community. Interacting with people and having meaningful conversation inspires my practice as a writer and thinker. 
Of course, my social interactions can also be full of hilarious misunderstandings or micro-aggressions that are just as inspiring to my art and thinking. Queerness and social critique is a large part of my practice.","http://morgansea.wordpress.com/performance-work/super-powers-the-slide-show/

It’s a piece that talks about my trans experience and queer politics with the question, “Which super power would you choose and why?” It gets pretty funny as, during the performance, I have a sort of existential crisis trying to find out if I am more into Shapeshifting or Telepathy. With shapeshifting, I could be as visually appealing as I wanted to be, gain various degrees of privilege, and explore amazing possibilities with a super-fluid queer body. With telepathy, I could change people’s minds and subtly shift their social-political views with persuasive comments that cater to their subconscious. However, could I trust myself not to straight up re-write their brain? What are the consent issues involved in telepathy? Which would I choose now? I still don’t know. Scratch that, shapeshifting, totally.
","I attended SMT in 2012. I really enjoyed the cooking, the conversation, and the creative peoples. I’ve also lived with a lot of roommates and generally aim to please within a communal space.","Session B, Unthinking/Unknowing sounds really good to me. The physicality of the Bourque's class sounds like a good way to break from my urban habitual laze and enter the space with an active body and mind.
The unthinkable makes me think  concepts or ideas that have become unspeakable, removed from societies lexicon. This seems like a good thing to meditate on an add to my queer theory toolkit in my ongoing battle with hegemonic oppression! 
I'm excited to explore Deleuzian concepts and think Bourque's background  experience teaching contemporary mythology would benefit my own practice which often queers ancient mythology, archetypes, and contemporary mythology.",,"I would like to make a series of short videos or photographic essays exploring the hierarchy  of Daedalus and the Minotaur . (Daedalus the greek mythological inventor not only built the apparatus for the Cretian Queen to mate with a bull, he also designed the Labyrinth that the beast man would spend his life in. Additionally supplying a special thread that would help Theseus navigate the Labyrinth and kill the Minotaur once and forall.) My vision would see the Minotaur set free in the Catskills. Daedalus and his son Icarus performing a wax dripped S&M practice. And giving unlimited funding, the creation of a stone maze for meditation. ","What does this open-ended question remind you of?
I’m standing soaking wet in front of a store clerk in Williamsburg. She thinks I should be embarrassed, and I am but only because there’s no easy way to explain that I feel great.
It’s hard to explain in a couple sentences how two weeks in the catskills had affected me. How in touch with my body and nature I felt, only to feel the violent contrast on a nauseating bus ride back to NYC. I was worried that connection was gone, but a 6 block walk in a warm thunderstorm felt fantastic and reminds me of a feelings I still can't describe.

",http://www.madelinesorenson.com/,Hike (A SUMMIT ON A SUMMIT),"I am a contradicting, well behaved, adventurous, uncertain, brief, efficient, un-hierarchical, chance-loving, unarticulated, optimistic, designer, dabbler, artist, jokester, service industry worker, non-theatrical performer, Minneapolis College of Art and Design graduate and list maker based in Portland, Oregon. ","My work is not bound by medium, but by method. I work within boundaries based on a conceptual logic, submitting to patterns and structures that exist naturally.  I search for and collect connections and contradictions. I misuse materials and re-appropriate objects. I engage in futile gestures to provoke confusion, seeking out the awareness that occurs through redundancy and subverted functionality. I question when and where art really exists. I collaborate with groups of people as an instigator and facilitator. I challenge cliches and play games with words. I build the box and ask for others to step out of it. 
","One of my most recent artistic endeavors has been teaching. Last summer I taught a process and idea generation class for 9 to 12 year olds at the Rochester Art Center in Minnesota. While the class at the RAC was for young students, the projects and class structure are similar to activities that I would like to facilitate with adults. I like to act as an amateur teacher, a teacher that knows less than the students. I pose questions with no answers and instigate conversation. The project at the RAC examined a playful logic and encouraged students to draw conclusions and make connections between seemingly unlike things, while working within a given set of restrictions.  
My curating project, POWERPOINT,  also represents my system of working within a set of invented boundaries. For this exhibition I solicited works by artists and non-artists created using only PowerPoint. The show resulted in  a collection of 2D images, animations, slide shows, sculptures and books.  The boundaries set by the program brought limitations that, through operation, provoked a consciousness of the making process and ultimately dictated the product. ","Aside from living with roommates throughout college, I have attended summer camp, worked as a summer camp counselor, and volunteered on farms, all of which I was living with and sharing space with others. The most communal living experience I have had was volunteering on farms in Minnesota, Holland and Belgium, where I contributed daily to the homestead by cooking, cleaning, building, and working in the gardens and fields along the other volunteers and farmers. 
","I believe the collaborative and kinetic nature of the School of Making and Thinking would have an extremely positive impact on my practice. Summit on a Summit, specifically, would be a beautiful opportunity to challenge myself physically, observe myself , learn from others and escape my everyday. On the hike, I would hope to challenge my improvisation skills, and focus on becoming more aware of the moments that I enter a most thoughtful state of mind.
","Making Assumptions & Drawing Conclusions Workshop:
We will each choose a random object found in nature. These objects will become our readymades for which we would generate a title and artist statement/manifesto/description/poem. Based only on what we can glean from the found object we will assign it meaning and determine it's function as an art object. Our tools would be signs and symbols, metaphors and analogies. We would conclude the workshop with a presentation and conversation about the works. 
","I would like to do a series of small interventions, experiments and exercises with others and by myself that respond to and question the environment. I am unsure if this would result in a ""final product"" or if it would exist as a continuous performance of sorts.  My project would hopefully represent the group as a whole and the individuals within.

http://vimeo.com/user11061019",https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B11VEEl-vgMlbC1QLTJwY0lRVk0/edit?usp=sharing,Hike (A SUMMIT ON A SUMMIT),"Born and raised in Montreal, I am presently completing a Master of Fine Arts at the School for Contemporary Arts, Simon Fraser University, in Vancouver. Prior to undertaking my MFA, I completed an MA at the Centre for Drama, theatre and Performance Studies, University of Toronto, in 2012. My research and creative practice explores identity and belonging, juggling with my experience as an interdisciplinary artist/researcher/human being in an increasingly homogenized society. 

The focus of my artistic practice lies in willess acts of self-affirmation around space (public and private), time, and identity. I am interested in revisiting place by reconfiguring our conception and use of space in the everyday through scored and task-oriented actions. The body becomes the site for my exploration, while repetition, endurance and resistance test the physical and emotional boundaries of my corporeal matter. Working at the edges of discomfort and vulnerability, I continuously re-evaluate the threshold of my body as it breaks down and rebuilds to become a site for change and exchange. I perform the friction of skin against architecture and nature. My hope is to generate knowledge through acts that most have discarded as unfeasible, unthinkable, and absurd. Embodying text and challenging language are fundamental to addressing identity and posing critical perspectives on authority.

I am a long distance runner and I am a lover of the outdoors. When not focusing on my research and practice, I enjoy all types of physical activity and exertion. Throughout my life I have actively participated in team sports since they fulfill my need for exchange and community while practicing physical exercise. In the past three years, I have sought opportunities to bridge my practice/research with my enthusiasm for the outdoors through play and collaborative endeavors in mobile residencies. I enjoy combining my academic background and intellectual capacities with the practicalities of everyday living – to take part in the communal exchange of experience and idea based activities.
","My creative/intellectual practice is in constant oscillation between spaces of extensive collaboration and focused individual isolation. Collaboration allows me to explore and expand my practice beyond its natural scope. As an artist and thinker, I recognize my intellectual and physical limitations and in doing so actively seek others to help me develop new methods of information creation. Within a collaborative exchange, I find ways to immerse myself in environments (be it urban or rural) that would be otherwise entirely foreign to me.

My interests lie in collaboration as a means of emergence – allowing group dynamics within a variety of settings to inform, transform and guide my practice and that of others. I believe in cohabitation as a means of furthering knowledge in a project, of letting time unfurl as dynamic practice-based encounters reveal new patterns in the bodies and minds of each collaborator. I am interested in the idea of community building in order to transport the encounters beyond their initial framework. My process is about sharing – creating rhyzomatic matrixes of connections and experiences with other bodies in space. In order to do so, I open up my projects to the greater public, inviting them to contribute, challenge, and transform its course according to their own life experience. I enter every project in anticipation that it will somehow, at some point, leave my hands to become molded by the minds of others.

I must also acknowledge that there are times when the collaborative act becomes one of tension in my work. In these times, when ideas collide and actions oppose, I find myself to be the most amazed at what can emerge from individuals not meshing. The balance between my own practice and others begins to blur in these instances, and so we begin an important process of negotiation and communication.
","In SHUTTLE (Summer 2013) I joined a group of international artists, designers, performance makers and researchers in a journey through the deserts of the American south-west performing an exploration of the aesthetic, political, cultural and environmental resonances of desert ecologies. As a temporary travelling community, our interests were in movement, environment, and performance. Our work consisted of generating new creative practices and works that shuttled between registers of the known and unknown by exploring performances of mobility. Journeying through seminal land arts works, ancient settlements, desert conditions, and spaces of transit, we performed daily actions creating ephemeral conditions and generating encounters. Our experience took us through an initial and closing event in Tucson, Arizona, and a five-day performance at Performance Studies International (Psi 19) conference at Stanford University in Paolo Alto. We travelled close to four thousand miles from Tucson and back in a white Chevrolet van moving through the Sonoran, Great Basin and Mojave Deserts.

SHUTTLE explored notions of creative and everyday cohabitation that have prepared and made me seek out more collaborative laboratories that allow for an intense and condensed period of exchange to occur. The constant process of negotiation between each individual of the group, the attempts and desire to fulfill both collective and personal goals, as well as the commitment to each other to hold a communal practice shared by all made for an intense environment of mobile performance and dialogue. The final product of the project was part collaborative and part individual. However, a clear overlap and strong influence occurred between the participants pushing the boundaries of each other’s work in different directions.
","During the summer of 2013, I spent two months at Nes Artist Residency in Skagastrond, Iceland. During this time, I shared a family-sized home with three people. Spending most of our days in this space, our group developed a strong relationship with each other that manifested itself through cooking, eating, working, and playing together. Each night of the week a different member of the household cooked a meal, with the rest of the group contributing to its preparation. We used this time to exchange ideas about work and more importantly to discover things about the other people. In the evening, we often played games, usually suggested and organized by a different person each night. These served not only to strengthen our bond as a group of artists living together, but also contributed to the works being created during the daytime. We also began exploring notions of collaboration together. Although nothing complete transpired, our exchanges provided fertile ground for creative stimulation.

In SHUTTLE, every aspect of the trip revolved around communal living. The group slowly began to work as a well-oiled machine as tasks and responsibilities became divided within the group. Many have remarked since the end of the trip that the act of everyday living (communally) was the very essence of the collaboration. 
","My interest in applying to the hike this summer stems from a desire to return and continue exploring notions of mobile collaboration and performance within a natural setting. As a city dweller, I find it necessary to regain contact with nature whenever I can. This challenges my practice and thinking to move out of its habitual relationship to the spatial structure of the urban context and to adapt itself to a different setting. My daily practice often relies on the concrete structures that I dwell and evolve in. These formations become points for me to anchor my physical actions and critical thinking. Outside of the city, living of a packsack and subjected to the power of nature, I develop new and different perspectives and physical actions that would not manifest themselves otherwise. My hope is to break with the monotonous and cyclical behaviour of urban living by immersing myself in a natural context where thinking and doing manifest themselves differently and out of necessity.

I am also hoping that the hike, in its collaborative and cohabitation structure, will aid in developing my individual practice and give way to a collective bond. My desire is to take part in a community experience that will expand beyond the session – to make contacts and relationships that will begin to inform further exchanges. As an artist who works through a critical embodiment of space and place my work will inevitably become shaped by the minds and anatomies of those who will participate in the hike. Hopefully, I can bring others into my process and lend myself to theirs in order to develop a dialogue.

The hike, in its relationship to the Central Catskills offers a chance to explore a geographical region that I have grown up driving through and had little firsthand contact with. My hope is to engage the region as a thinker, creator, and human being in order to become more knowledgeable about its ecological structure and habitat. 
","The workshop I would most likely want to lead during the hike revolves around a series of actions that I have recently developed with an at-risk high school youth group. The workshops reflect on notions of collective walks as spaces of potential insurrection and change. In their current form, they combine immersive lectures and workshops, drawing from art history, popular culture, an embodied practice, and notions of play.

The proposed work involves bringing members of the hike together with a one-meter rope. A direct reference to Linda Montano and Tehching Hsieh’s One Year Performance 1983-1984 (Rope Piece) where the two artists tied themselves with a one-meter rope for an entire year. The workshop explores the physical and psychological manifestation of ‘being tied or roped’ together. What emerges is an interesting collective effort as individuals negotiate being bound together and fulfilling certain tasks/needs in their immediate environment. The workshop would also include a lecture portion where historical precedents for this type of bondage is exhibited, therefore furthering the intellectual exercise of understanding the act being performed. I would anticipate beginning the workshop with groups of two being bound, and slowly work our way until the whole group is tied together thus forming a collective body. The performative actions and thinking that would develop would inevitably be linked to the natural environment we evolve in. The workshop would take this setting into consideration and adapt to the space in order to connect gestures and actions back to the site.
",,"How does it feel to ascribe to a ‘global’ art system? A striking issue in applying for international residencies is that the mode of life that has developed around them is one of privilege. The 21st century ‘mobility’ of the artist figure is an issue that I am interested in, and struggle with regularly. As a Canadian and son of two professionals, I am aware that the movement I follow is in great part a product of my socio-economic standing rather than a sign of a ‘true’ democratic global art system whereby artists can travel freely and participate in residencies. It is this sense of unease in mobility that brings me to ground myself, to look for self-aware communities of artists who recognize their local environment and respect it.

While I hate the way that sounds, I like the way it looks. By both honoring and critiquing work of this nature, I make comments on the tradition of “Sunday Afternoon Painters”. My subject matter can be read as sentimental, but I see it as a recording of time. The sun is setting, the moon is moving, and the flowers are dying. How one brush stroke leads to the next is more important to me that the subject matter—the subject matter is just the vehicle to get me from point A to point B. For me, it all comes back to paint on paper. In a current series of paintings, the circle in the form of the moon, sun, streetlights, and balloons formally ties the work together. My work involves a vigorous studio practice, painting everyday. At times, I paint outdoors in plein air on hikes and back packing trips. At night, I paint in my car utilizing my moon roof to capture the night sky. I am trying to reach nature from an unnatural place. My work is a recording of the suburban landscape. 

On a less formal note, I am a navy brat who has lived in more houses than years I have been alive. I have a one-eyed dog and two cats. Currently, I am finishing up my last semester of grad school in sunny and humid Tampa, Florida, looking ahead to the next adventure.  
","While I still love the romanticized vision of the artist alone in their studio, for me, it’s not a realistic one. My creative practice is collaborative mostly in the sense that I depend on an audience for critique and feedback on an idea or a body of work in progress. I find discussing the ends and outs of particular idea helpful for my own process. In order for my work to be effective I want to find out what is working both visually and conceptually. A collaborative audience provides that valuable feedback to aid in making my creative process stronger. Having been in graduate school for the past three years, I have received this collaboration though the institution of academia. Now that I am leaving academia, I want to search out this richness in conversation from new sources. In addition, I also collaborate within an artist collective called EyeSplice, featuring twelve artists around the country and South America. Together we have formed a network to exhibit together, provide critiques, and work on our professional development. We have upcoming shows in Long Island City, NY and Tampa, FL. Working with this group provides me with support and accountability. We hold each other up to certain standards and look out for opportunities that would benefit one another or the whole group. Again, while the lone artist may be a romantic vision, it’s an impractical one. As artists/thinkers supporting one another leads to richer work and lives. ",http://www.briananicolephelps.com/paintings/,"While most nights were not spent sleeping there, I feel my graduate school studio provided one of my many communal living experiences. When you’re spending an average of eight or more hours a day in a shared space, it becomes a community, or at least it should. Luckily for me, my experience led to a wonderful exchange of ideas, supplies and support. When I needed advice, someone was usually there to take a look at a piece or bounce an idea off of. When I ran out of something, there was a chance someone had some more. Most importantly, in the moments I doubted myself, one of my colleagues provided with me with support to keep me going. I was also there to provide the same for my studio mates. While the studio wasn’t my actual home, the sense of community there made it feel like one. ","The theme of this course is what first brought me to apply to The School of Making Thinking. Recently, I had a discussion with my mentor and professor Elisabeth Condon about my work’s approach to the natural through the unnatural. Like the Tonalist before me, my work is in part a reaction to the industrialization and suburbanization of the natural world. In a way, my work is a survey of the suburban landscape. Part of my reasoning for painting outdoors in natural spaces allows me an attempt at connecting with the natural world and recording this attempt with paint on paper. However, unlike the Tonalist, there is an unnatural quality to my work, too far removed from the natural state. This is why I am interested in exploring whether or not it’s possible to reconnect with The Wild.",,"I would like to remain as open as possible at this point in order to fully benefit from the experience of the residency, although I can confidently envision painting as the main aspect of the project. I believe being able to explore the area, as you state—socially, intellectually, and environmentally will inspire new work much in the same way that Florida has. I imagine spending a lot of time outdoors painting and pondering.","What the best thing you’ve ever won?

When I was in the sixth grade, we lived in Hawaii in military housing. I went to a dance at the recreation center and bought a raffle ticket. I won a ride on a submarine—that was yellow! My parents kept making jokes and reciting Beatles lyrics in the weeks between winning and going. I got to see an octopus crawling along the ocean floor. It’s one of my most vivid memories.

I'm very passionate about experimental narrative filmmaking and I think about it all the time. In my day to day life, I live in Brooklyn and I'm playing it by ear.  I write a lot: mostly absurd/surreal narratives.  I spend a lot of time working on films and music videos, and also helping friends make their own things. I like comedy and laughing and making people laugh.  I'm also really interested in experimental comedy, especially irony - and maybe also kind of shock humor and vulgarity as they related to absurdity? I don't know.","Is it okay if I'm not sure?  I like to have conversations and talks with other people about art and philosophy, because I just find it really stimulating.

","I have always been interested in meditation, ever since my dad taught me to meditate at an early age. I am fascinated by an artistic practice that seeks zen moments of creativity, in which artistic will is able to flow free and unobstructed. And I guess the flip side of the coin is that when I'm not actively creating, I spend a lot of time thinking, mulling things over, self-analyzing. ",,"I am interested in experimenting with an artistic process that merges writing and creating with personal ritual and spirituality. I'd like to structure my days of writing with rituals like meditation and physical movement interspersed throughout, and make the conscious choice to engage with these rituals spiritually and existentially. I am curious about how that will affect my writing and my experience of writing and my experience of living - especially because in urban NYC I feel like I rarely engage with any spirituality or personal ritual.  I'd maybe even hope to stage scenes from this writing with other people at SMT to feel out how they work, and whether a ritualistic writing process might yield a different performance process for an actor/collaborator.","WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?

I don’t want to unlearn what I learned in school, because much of it was valuable to my intellectual development and creative practice. Rather, I’m trying to re-inhabit the state of inhibition that I remember occupying before all of the high concept and theory. In my ideal state, I’m able to create in a way that is unencumbered and fluid, and my creative mind is in constant dialogue (verging on unified) with my critical mind. Much of what I internalized about artistic discipline through higher education has formed an obstacle to the act of creation. Bit by bit, I am disintegrating that obstacle and allowing myself to play, enjoy not knowing, and let go of outcome expectations.

In order to achieve equilibrium, the next big step in my life is to find the right physical place and space to occupy and call home. This is essential. At the moment, I feel like I’m drifting through the sea, not in a huge hurry, not exactly sure where I’m headed, only certain that I’m going wash up onto the shore somewhere new. Over the past few years I’ve split my time between the Bay Area of California and the Research Triangle of North Carolina. In a couple of days, I depart for Iceland for a two-month residency in Reykjavík. When I return, the next move I make will be to my new home, and I’m excited about that. I just need to figure out where it will be. 

Rather than a biographic summary, this is me now, putting one foot in front of the other until I arrive.
","Conceptually, I consider all creative and intellectual work to be collaborative. Whether drawing, performing live, or writing a research paper, each expression is influenced and by all of the things I have learned, read, seen, heard, discussed, felt, and understood prior to the moment of expression. Any artist is in a collaborative relationship with the world around them at all times, and this relationship includes current events, media, trends in art, peers, creative partners, professional expectations, financial obligations, available materials, available work space, etc. Not only are the ideas that I have a result of my collaboration with the world around me, but the way my ideas manifest (and even which ideas I am able to manifest) depends greatly on who I am, what I have to work with, where I am, and when I’m doing it. I depend on collaboration at every moment. 

Actually, I collaborate with many peer artists. I view my network of fellow creatives as a resource for mutual support and growth. Since 2009, I have been working with a group called The Performance Collective, which I helped found in Chapel Hill, NC during my time as an undergraduate. Our work is original, devised, experimental performance, which we develop through a process of ideation based on sharing, exchange, and improvisation. It is in this process that I developed not only the capacity to work with other artists, but the ability drop my focus on authorship, say yes, and co-create. This experience has undoubtedly been a benefit across the board in my life. Besides TPC, I have done collaborative projects, from building renovations to essays, with many groups, including Rock Paper Scissors Collective (Oakland), Signify Sanctify Believe! (LA), the Xhurch (Portland), Girltown (multi-city), The Queer Explorer’s Club (NYC / Greensboro, NC), Queerlab (Greensboro, NC) and Elsewhere (Greensboro, NC). 
","The 2012/2013 project I created with The Performance Collective members Brian Hicks and Larissa Kaul called “(YOU YOURSELF WE WE ARE ARE WE) EVEN HERE <?” was all about asking and answering questions related to gender, identity, and performance.  We began with a set of questions about queerness and art and knew we wanted to turn the exploration of these questions into a performance. Over the course of three months, we did writing exercises, improvisational movement research, had many discussions, and turned our thoughts into images, sequences, and eventually a show. Not every project I do takes the form of an hour-long performance, but the process tends to be similar, starting with questions and using whatever media I am focusing on to express my thoughts, answers, and sometimes even the questions themselves. 

I like to make art that is political, but not polemical. I imagine that the best thing a piece of (political) art can do is confuse someone who thinks they already know the answer. Art can / should ask questions and start / participate in conversations. I try to use creative processes and critical research processes interchangeably, so that art projects become an educational experiment. Each project is ultimately about learning something or at least understanding it better than when I started. I believe that this approach is very much in line with SMT’s pursuit to, “expand traditional notion[s] of thinking.” Academia encourages you to have a thesis that you can support with other people’s previous work or a hypothesis that you seek to prove. This approach can be valuable, but when you’re looking for something specific, you’re likely to miss other things that are there. The practice I have described is more of an attempt to travel through questions without a destination in mind.
","As an undergraduate, I was part of a co-ed literary and arts society called St. Anthony Hall. We had a house, which was a residence for (give or take) seven people, but a part-time home for anywhere between twenty and thirty. I lived there for a little over two years. Luckily, it was an overall positive experience, but it was full of challenges, compromises, and lessons. In addition to simply sharing space, we coordinated regular chapter meals, shared cleaning responsibilities, and undertook projects on campus and in the community together. In hindsight, I’m always proud of how well we organized it all, even if it was chaotic on the surface. As a member of The Hall (as we called it) I learned that clear communication and a constructive, cooperative attitude are essential to the mental health of everyone involved.  I have numerous friends who have had negative communal living experiences, both in coops and normal multi-roommate houses. In all of these situations a lack of communication and/or bad attitudes were the culprit(s). We had some rough times at The Hall, but we did a great job of trusting and supporting each other while identifying the problems and dealing with them.","I’m drawn to “Unthinking / Unknowing” because, as I began to explain in my “About Me” section, I am currently in the process of undoing certain aspects of my higher education training in an attempt to re-learn ways I was working creatively before then. The idea that, “Thinking is always something that happens when we are least prepared, unexpecting, unknowing,” resonates with me deeply. This is something that I do my best to lean into in my artistic practice. The content of this session is related to conceptual interests of mine (especially Deleuze and also the work of Paolo Friere) and will use methods I am comfortable with and greatly enjoy (especially physical and meditation practices).  I am excited about the combination of physical, textual, and internal approaches described in the session information, because it seems to parallel the type of process that I have undertaken in the development of prior work, especially performance. This is a unique opportunity to engage in this type of process with a group of completely new people and without the purpose of creating a performance at the end of it all. What else could come out of this work? I am eager to find out! As I said in the above section, when we are looking for a specific outcome, we miss other possibilities. In lieu of working towards a performance, there is great potential for something I have not even imagined to manifest, which is very exciting to me. Finally, from what I have read about SMT, the exchange between / among “teachers” and “students” seems to be much more symbiotic than in a traditional learning environment. I feel like this is a session that I will not only benefit from attending, but to which I will be able to make meaningful contribution.",I am not applying to the Hike. ,"At SMT I would challenge myself to do something outside of, or at least not primarily focused in, my normal repertoire, which would be some sort of devised or improvised performance, probably involving a video or other visual art element. I’ve been leaning toward the medium of sound lately, and that is a skill set I want to develop further. Given unlimited funding, I’d invest in recording tools and production equipment, and focus my energies to this end. In keeping with SMT's encouragement of intermedia projects, I’d seek ways to activate and incorporate a variety of media and creative / critical strategies. I've recently been very interested in how contemporary technology, such as mobile devices - laptops, cell phones, tablets, etc. - and the Internet can be used in live performance, activated for audience participation, etc. These tools that we interact with constantly are primarily used for information, but I want to explore the potential of their non-intended uses, especially as sonic instruments. This relates to the session to which I'm applying in that engaging with technologies in this way requires a certain amount of purposeful forgetting / unknowing the assumed rules and boundaries of these tools.","What is your aspiration in life? Like Beyoncé says in ""Pretty Hurts,"" my aspiration in life is to be happy, but what does that look like? For me, a young artist doing my best to carve out a sustaining creative career, happiness looks like being debt-free, having a place (maybe separate places) where I can comfortably work and live, being able to support myself and the people I love with my work, and doing work that not only pays the bills but that is constructive, innovative, and inspirational to as many people as possible.

I'm taking an experimental optics class right now, and I think I could probably nerd out about light for like 10 hours straight.","I would just give everyone on the hike a projector gun so that we could be this roving light parade or light installation that is constantly making its way through the forest and is probably also visible at a distance. What would we be projecting? I'm not sure, photographs of the forest onto itself. Poems about nature... At another SMT session I asked everyone to write down their dreams and I constructed poems out of people's dreams. Maybe we'd just do this the whole hike long and project our dreams onto the forest.","Do you want to fall in love at SMT?

Spent time in the Midwest for School (undergraduate studies at Oberlin in Ohio, graduate studies at The Art Institute of Chicago. For the year and a half I have lived and work in Brooklyn. I am a video and performance artist. I work in time based mediums and am very interested in time as a medium-- slow time, collapsed time, repeating time. I also work as a teaching artist in New York. This practice is very important to me as well, spending time teaching art in New York City public schools feeds my artistic practice and vice versa. I like to teach, talk, dance, eat and make art. ","In my creative practice I often use 'participants' to generate material that is then used in my video projects. I create structures in which 'participants' can contribute thoughts, words, perspectives etc. I consider these 'participants' collaborators in some way. 

Example of such a project can be seen here:

I also have worked on a number of more traditionally collaborative projects with fellow artists. Below are some examples:

Over and over again I turn to my external world and the people in it (both friends and strangers) to aid me in my creative process. Between reading groups, traditional and less traditional modes of collaboration, I feel that the people around me are constantly influencing my practice, process and perception.

Below is a link to a video project entitled, Dedication to this View. It is a 45-minute video that pieces together original and found footage to create a long, meditative work addressing themes of distance, concealment, sexuality and the act of viewing. Though theme was clear when I began the project, the process of taking and then editing the footage organic and highly institutive. This way of making is very different from other projects of mine that use structure and constraints in their process. The majority of the material was shot with an iPhone, at times entering into the realm of the diaristic and banal, producing a video that acknowledges the tool of its production. The video builds through a process of compilation and in its careful attention to rhythm and pattern, and attempts to push the banality of living in the world until its strangeness is exposed. The informal performances and occurrences of day-to-day life that are chronicled in the video are abutted by altered footage from historical film and performance art. Dedication of this View acts as representation of, and meditation on, the intersection between these considerations. As the video weaves together a series of sources, the subjectivity of the artist/performer/editor emerges as the constant and is continually projected into the frame of both original and found footage. This video and the process I engaged to produce it felt to me to be a process of unthinking, of allowing my daily life to bleed into my artistic life and vice versa. I was interested in breaking down and challenging the way I was ‘knowing’ and approaching my artistic practice while in graduate school. 

An excerpt: https://vimeo.com/52748764
Full video (40 min long): https://vimeo.com/60756183",My most recent communal living experience was last year. I spent a month at a residency in Italy. I shared a room with three other women and shared a kitchen and living space with 16 international residents. We made did communal grocery shops and made communal meals. We spent our days working together on a publication that was put out by Mousse Publishing. The residency was particular in that we were not only living communally but we were also collaborating together throughout the month. ,"I am very interested in the idea of unthinking/unknowning. After my time in graduate school (I graduated Spring 2011) I have spent a lot of time attempting to 'unknow' some of what I was taught or exposed to during the two intense years. I felt in many ways that my practice during school became too ridged and didactic. I believe an artistic, intellectual, creative practice thrives when there is a balance between critical rigorous inquiry and open ended process based play or discovery. Recently I have been spending some time at an Ashram upstate and beginning a mediation practice. Beyond my interest in cultivating spiritual practice, I have been excited to learn what thinking without thinking might do for my creative practice. I feel the class and its theme would touch upon a lot of the questions I am most engaged with right now in terms of how I approach life and my practice of making. It would be very beneficial to have a group of thinkers/makers to be in conversation with around these topics, as much of my work/thinking around this theme has up to this point been solo.

In the recent years, my practice has grown more solitary while my research more collaborative. In a sense I am within the times if I think about shareware, and open-source. I think my R&D in groups, with artists coming from varied practice – UQAR with a group of 20 mature artists in the north of Quebec, MPA with 20 professional visual artists women in and around Montreal, PBR at Stanford (MOOC) with a chore group of 5 professionals, artists & engineers from 3 continents (where I met Michael Borowski, alumni STM student), and RAIQ the Quebec group of interdisciplinary artists. At this time in my evolution as an artist, I am exploring the process of creation through my body as my principal media. Sharing ideas and process with other practicing artists and agents of change is my  way of communal thinking and creating.
Prior to my solo exploration through alter ego Dalidada, I have and still remain with a pan-Canadian clown collective (Les Babines), and curated and plan to reactivate in time Artist as Shaman, a multidisciplinary performances and installations exhibit mixing old and new technologies – the proposition to artists is to pair with an artist of a different field and while creating their own piece, feeding off of each other's process and present at the same time. “Under the Nose” (clown) was presented in Winnipeg during the 2011 Fringe festival and “Artist as Shaman” at Eastern Bloc during the Art Matters Festival 2012.

The most collaborative think-work I have fostered which continues to influence on my practice is homônumos, where a mix of artists and non-artists of many cultures discoursed on a theme. homônumos means 'all humans share one family'. Our mascot is 'siren' which is the 'one human with an idea' ( see Twitter image above) The foundation of homônumos was built on fostering a common sense of belonging, building on our differences such as it existed in the 8th century Alhambra, the sharing of philosophies, arts and science. I have been researching since my return in Montreal how to bring back homônumos presented as a digital open shareware.
My favourite articles are those I worked on with non artists because they led to a self discovery, repositioning of perspectives, and an opening to auto-determination for all parties. I asked a shop clerk I met at the Russian market to translate a bedtime story of her childhood into English. It turns out she spoke 4 languages with no common roots (Buryat, Russian, English, Mandarin)! I asked her to note when she had to think of a word in Russian or Mandarin. In this way, we mapped her language process. Another favourite article was written by Beijing local&in-the-closet queer tour-guide, reflecting on the dual street names of Guo da jie and Dongzhimenwai da jie albeit in a non historical discourse. And finally, blessed was our round table with Taoist priest in Dali Yunnan and German Protestant pastor in Beijing discoursing on infinity.
Co-directed as a pair, the team selected articles on commission, by people we met in Beijing, in our travels, and through our social network on the subjective basis of simply wanting to hear what a person had to say on a specific thematic. We further asked the contributors to express themselves in the language they thought of the idea so as to preserve the essence of the original thought. The note from the editor and the round table were translated in French, English, and Mandarin. homônumos topped 8 languages in one issue within its first year of publication. Distributed at 1000 units, we sold the magazine in Beijing, Thailand, Hong Kong, it was distributed in literature departments in USA, art galleries in France, sino-science as archive in Belgium' national library, and grassroot cafes in London, We infiltrated DIAF international art festival and are featured in their catalogue without ever having been invited, we self-funded 2 years of existence on print and in-situ performances. While being expelled from Beijing in 2008 in the midst of the Olympic corruption, homônumos disintegrated.

I spent the previous year as an Arts Fellow at The Drisha Institute of Jewish Education studying Torah with a creative focus on death, destruction, and resurrection in the Talmud. I received my BA from the University of Chicago in 2012, where I studied the intersection of aesthetics and ethics through literature and the visual arts. 

My artistic practice stems from a fundamental fascination with the permeability of bodily borders. I investigate the ways in which we experience and process our physicality and materiality in the face of what lies beyond our bodies and our lived experience. I am heavily influenced by the texts and practices of various religious and spiritual doctrines, as well as literature and philosophy that addresses death, aesthetics, faith, emotion, and ethics. Profound attention to the written word, as well as texture, movement, and space, is the foundation for constructing multi-disciplinary art experiences that audience members can access through various layers of consciousness. My work is meant to bring viewers into confrontation with the limits of being in order to recognize the inherent beauty of what lies on either side, in order to transcend fear and liberate pain. I seek to temper the morbid and the grotesque with a reverence for details, to infuse the shadows with grace.
","I am very attached to conversation as a tool for processing any stage of creation, from idea generating to logistics. This allows me to clarify concepts and refine details. Whether or not I am collaborating with another person in the traditional sense of sharing authorship, I rely on conversation and consider it a collaborative practice.

Currently, I am collaborating on an experimental film adaptation of a Kafka short story with my brother, an NYC based filmmaker. We began by closely reading the text and building off of each other's interpretations until we aligned our vision of the text. We used these thoughts as a foundation for the screenplay, which we debated at length. Now, we are in the midst of story-boarding the screenplay; we discuss what is contained in each image and its significance, how this moment should affect the viewer, and how we can best frame the moment to achieve this. 

Last spring, I co-choreographed a performance piece based on the tahara, the Jewish ritual washing of the dead. The two of us usually focused our energies on different aspects of the work: I was more concerned with the conceptual framework, while my partner was more interested in specific movements and transitions. Much of the work consisted of us moving around in a room together, testing our ideas, and discovering what we both liked. 

I am eager, always, to experience new collaborative structures.

Ani Hashem Rofecha: A Cabinet of Curiosity 

The Cabinet of Curiosity, also known as a Cabinet of Wonder, or a Wonder-room, was an encyclopedic collection of objects whose categorical boundaries were as yet undefined.  A precursor to the museum, this European Renaissance form was likened to a ""theater of the world"" and conveyed a certain control of the world. The attempt to classify the unclassified, to possess the elusive, created the illusion that profound knowledge had been grasped. While these cabinets are impressive, their contents spark more questions than answers. Indeed, the Cabinet of Curiosity conveys an attempt to know, and the impossibility of doing so. 

Drawing from Chapter 11 of Tractate Sanhedrin of the Babylonian Talmud, I have created and curated a Curiosity Cabinet of objects and ideas. Through the micronarratives in Sanhedrin, we attempt to know God and (wo)man, and in turn, we are given only holy fragments, fragments of a disembodied God and disembodied (wo)man. This cabinet explores God as destroyer, healer and redeemer. The Cabinet of Curiosity doubles as a medicinal cabinet for a body that is entirely decontextualized, wherein bone and viscera encounter the destroying, resurrecting, redeeming, healing God before we do. 
","Among the many communal living experiences I've had, the most colorful was the month I spent in Tsfat, in the very north of Israel, in an all women's seminary for the study of ultra-orthodox mystical Judaism. The expectations of this community were beyond anything I could've imagined: we were to keep our knees, elbows, and collar bones covered; we were to pray, as best as we could, three times a day; and we were discouraged from interacting with men, should the rare opportunity present itself. I was more aware of my collar bones than I had ever been in my life, developed an intense fondness for the utility of scarves, and sang out loud despite the rebuke of our male security guard. I learned deeply how far I could stretch myself for the sake of community and how far I was willing to go. Despite the everyday frustrations of my short visit to this world, I forged profound connections with my seminary mates, whether through contemplating the nature of God or laughing at ourselves before bed. 
","The very idea that thinking is a creative act spurs my artistic practice. I am very drawn to a critical approach, and have struggled with the idea that critical analysis can be understood as, by nature, deconstructive. The act of analysis, however, is an attempt at constructing meaning, which is a profoundly creative act. I would like to continue to explore this tension, which informs the core of my artistic practice. The course on Unthinking/Unknowing would be a perfect place to do so.

I am extremely interested in the limits of the body, and this fixation is coupled with the less urgent but ever powerful fascination with the limits of the mind. I am interested in exploring this through conceptually and experientially. In the work I create, I seek to draw attention to line between the known and the unknown, between this world and the next. Exploring this liminal space through thought and experience strikes me as particularly important, so that I might gain insight into how to bring audience attention to processing this liminal space when I create my own work. The course on Unthinking/Unknowing addresses my key interests through an innovative and multivalent approach, which appeals intensely to me. I work in a multi-disciplinary fashion in order to access the wisdom of articulated and unarticulated thought and emotion. This course would illuminate these access points and deepen my practice substantially. 
",,"I would like to mount an interactive installation that investigates death, memory, and loss. The space would resemble a bedroom and be laden with objects and clues about who once inhabited the space. These three options would be valid: a. the room belonged to a deceased person; b. the room belongs to someone who may or may not be deceased, and who is speaking through the objects; c. the viewer is the deceased. The inclusion of relational objects would be an important aspect of the project, as well as the participation of one viewer at a time. The objects, as well as the space itself, would slip between the extremely mundane, the abject, and the surreal, thus sliding between an awareness of the body, at its most visceral, and the psyche, at its most detached. I would be keen on experimenting with how to blur the line between the felt and the seen; the sense of the living and the sense of the dead. This would ideally be a space of confrontation and healing.

I release electronic music as Ink Jet.

In terms of employment, currently I work both as a freelance composer (for commercials, film, etc.) and at a small design/branding agency as a producer (jack of all trades). I'm in the process of transitioning toward full time music/audio work.

As an artist/musician, I'm interested in the creative possiblities offered by manipulating sampled audio. The music I produce with samples ranges from basic hip-hop beats (""ripping off"" for bars and slapping some drums on it) to more involved productions composed of many tiny samples from various sources. Sampling is often derided as simple stealing, but I think producers like J Dilla, Madlib, the Avalanches, et al. clearly create artistic value with the choices they make. I aim to make music that brings the relationship between sampler and samplee to the forefront.

On a related note, I've also started writing about the effect that the interfaces of electronic music equipment have upon the music created with them. My current focus is on some of the classic samplers (MPC, SP-1200) used to make iconic hip-hop and house records. The UI of gear almost inevitably leads to specific musical choices, but I haven't seen these choices discussed outside of informal conversations with other electronic music producers.

I'm also interested in interactive music projects I'm currently developing a project tentatively titled Crowd Raps. I set up a phone line that, when you call in, plays a hip-hop instrumental. The caller is encouraged to rap or sing along to the beat, and anything they do is recorded to a server. The plan is to edit down the best calls and release them as completed tracks online.","My work is collaborative in a few different ways.

Most directly, I sometimes work on music with other artists, writing and playing together, or collaborating in different media (e.g., dance + music).

Currently I'm working on a project called Crowd Raps (described above) that's more of a combination of collaboration and curation. In it, I solicit singing and rapping from callers, then review their submissions and edit interesting together ones for release as the ""final product."" In this situation, the callers are reacting to music and creating something of their own, but they don't know how their own contribution will exist as part of the final work.

I'd also argue that in performing live as an electronic dance musician, the relationship between performer and dancers - traditionally viewed as performer/audience - can in fact be collaborative. I've been in situations where the music I played was directly influenced by activity on the dance floor.

All of that said, much of my work is produced entirely on my own. I'm interested in the School of Making Thing precisely because I want to open up my creative process to collaboration!","I've recently been releasing music under the name Ink Jet. Last summer, I put out my first record, Grandma Tapes.

The music on Grandma Tapes was composed with a set of strict rules: 1) Every sound on the record was sampled from a box of cassette tapes my grandmother left for me when she died. 2) Each track was created from samples of a single work by a (generally Romantic classical) composer. 3) I used a single hardware sampler to create the record; I wanted to stay away from working in the visual environment a computer offers.

These rules helped direct me through a creative process that examined the musical taste of a past generation while generating music that sounded vastly different. The experience of listening to the tapes was very emotional for me; I listened to them imagining how my grandmother had. It was also a way to deeply explore the technique of sampling; I learned to doing things like coax a dance-style kick drum out of a symphony.

Currently, I'm working on a series of musical sketches as part of a weekly project I call Natural Athleticism. Every Wednesday in 2014, I'm releasing a new track online. Each one is based on a rough idea from a list I've drawn up: e.g., ""make music claps that slowly grow into applause, then return to rhythmic clapping"". Natural Athleticism is a way to keep myself working through specific ideas that interest me, rather than simply ""writing songs"".

Both of these projects are linked above.","I spent my first two years in New York living with a group of other musicians. This wasn't an organized communal living experience so much as simply living with roommates, but it had a great effect on the art I created. Specifically, my proximity to people with different taste got me involved in styles/genres that I had previously never even tried to understand. E.g., I used to think that most four-to-the-floor dance music was too rhythmically simple to pay attention to; now I make some myself. Long story short, my experience of living with others was one of opening up my mind to different forms of expression.

Another thing that's important to me: communal food. I love to cook and eat with others, and hope that will be a part of the SMT experience.","""Between Nature and Culture"": to start with, I agree with the central conceit: wildness IS creatively enticing to me. Let me share a dream I had a couple years back:

I was a small four-legged creature, no distinct species, a proto-mammal. I spent my time lurking in the undergrowth of a forest by a clearing. I would peer out from the shadows and look at a sunny puddle of a milky pink liquid. I felt afraid of an unknown force (a predator above?) but when I worked up the courage, I would dart out to quickly sip at it, then jet back to the shadows. Then, I felt a pressure welling up inside of me. I walked out into the light, raised my little head up to the sky, and roared with my full body and soul, howled at the sun. Then I woke up.

I bring this up because the dream put me in touch with a sort wellspring of primal, weird energy within me that I had been ignoring or suppressing. And in the years since, I have failed to harness whatever powerful experience I had in that dream, though I've thought about it a lot. I realize that this might come across as absurd, but I hope that the Nature/Culture session might give me a helpful lens to address this topic of untapped wildness in myself.

I'm also intrigued by the subject of Unthinking/Unknowing. I'm always looking for situations that bring about creative thought, from running to meditation to substances to a shower. My current method of making art treats creative thought like work, providing a steady framework in which to let the mind free. I hope that this session would open me to a broader set of exercises that might change the way I think.",N/A,"Given unlimited funding, I would love to mount a massive sound installation on a chunk of woodland. I would set up sensors everywhere: microphones, thermometers, flex sensors to sense tree limbs flexing in the wind, infrared cameras, etc. The area would be rigged up like an embassy, but the technology would be hidden as much as possible. I'd use the feedback from these sensors to create a kind of amplified nature, a set of sounds that take direct audio from the microphones and process it based on other realtime data, expressing the conditions of the moment through sound in a way that a listener in that spot could intuitively understand.

Alternatively: given all those sensors, the piece could satirize the surveillance state. The participant is escorted to a hut with a computer terminal. They watch a real time read out of what's happening on the land, stylized like a security system in a movie. The participant is directed to complete a few simple tasks on the terminal, e.g., clicking on boxes to ensure levels are in line. At a predetermined point, the system would ""malfunction"", and the real time sound described above would roar all around the participant.","What kind of artist would you like to encounter at SMT?

Of course, I'm open to anyone I might encounter, and I want to be surrounded by a diverse group of people. But one type of artist I think is underrepresented in the ""serious art"" world: comedians. I'd love to have comedians working out new material alongside all the other artists and writers. In general I enjoy art that has a sense of humor, and I think having someone who specializes in humor around would enrich the experience for everyone.",None for either of these periods.,Through a friend,No restrictions

","   The ""Yawning Booth"" installation is an environmental and audio sensory experience. It is a booth shaped like an out house that people go to yawn in. Inside the booth soft sounds of me continuously yawning illustrate interconnectivity and mirror neurons in the brain as the audio yawn is ""caught"", or passed from one body to another. The yawn enters through the first person's ears in the booth, is absorbed into the body and then reflected back out through the yawning body into the eyes of a live camera, so that elsewhere that yawn will be passed to the video viewer through the eyes. An onlooker can then observe this person yawning in real time, and then receive and pass along more yawns through live observation and so on.

I’m currently finishing up my MFA at the University of Iowa.  I gave up a tenured job teaching art to high school students to return to school.  While most people get their MFA so they can teach, I did the opposite.  I love academia, and spent the three years prior to becoming a high school teacher getting an MA in Art Education, but am excited to be finished with it for a while.  Due to the dearth of queer studies at the university I’m at, I’ve become a bit of an autodidact in the field, which relates to my work, where I address issues/ideas around the development of queer subjectivity.  For many years I lived in the San Francisco Bay Area where, prior to teaching (and a bit less while living a professional lifestyle), I played in bands and had an amazing house in the Mission where I hosted tons of pop shows.  Because of that, I’ve been able to travel extensively, which is something I love.  I recently met and talked to Yvonne Ranier, who I really connected with when I told her I studied classical ballet for nine years, and was excited to talk with her about bringing my past as a performer into my current visual-art practice.  Which is something I’ve been trying to do and thinking a lot about. I’m trying to commit entirely to my creative practice.  While most of my colleagues are applying for jobs, I’m applying to residencies.  This commitment is scary, because it means no income, transience and precarity.  There is a part of me who just wants house-plants and a cat, but I feel like now is the time to throw caution to the wind and see what happens. I’m excited! ","I guess one theme of my life, whether it’s been having shows at my house or teaching in the classroom, has been community building.  This is important to me because I believe that we only truly begin to know ourselves through our encounter with others.  While the majority of my creative practice has been a kind of traditional, studio based one, I’ve always imagined it to be based in communication and just one tool through which to experience that encounter.  Lately though, I’ve been expanding what it means to create work that is in communication with the viewer and make work that actually requires the viewer to participate in order to be complete.  I’m trying to collaborate with my viewer not just in the creation of meaning, but in an actual physical experience as well.  So, a dance floor that asks you to step up and make a spectacle of yourself, for example, is a different experience than just looking at an object or performance as a viewer.  I always thought of my teaching practice as collaborative, and I’ve been lucky through my teaching to have found an actual collaborative partner (you’ll learn a bit more about that in the next section). While here at the University of Iowa I have collaborated with another person in my department to build community through the organization of a queer print exchange portfolio that’s going to be shown at the Southern Graphics Council International Printmaking Conference.  Part of the reason I wanted to participate in an MFA program was for the critical community and the opportunity for growth that can be experienced through collaborative thinking and dialogue.  I’ve been lucky to have that community the past three years and I hope to continue to figure out ways to keep having it. ","In 2012 I participated in an artist residency in Northern NM called PLAND (Practice Liberating Art through Necessary Dislocation).  It consisted of living in a trailer for three weeks with my collaborator, who used to be my student, in the desert outside of Taos.  Rather than write a description of it here, I would ask that you follow the link to the collaboratively written piece we wrote for the Notes on Looking website titled “Take A Sauna”.  Thanks

http://notesonlooking.com/2012/10/take-a-sauna/","My most intense communal living experience would probably be that of a touring band.  Several times in my life I have been on tour with more than nine people at once.  Living in this way, making decisions, trying to find some personal solitude while packed in a van, sardined on the living room of some strangers house, or back stage, or even just being able to navigate the myriad issues that come up when nine plus egos are trying to find consensus on where to eat in some unknown city can be crazy making.  I have found though, that I'm a good peace-maker.  I've always been a good listener and very empathetic, but with little tolerance for BS and not really afraid to call it.  That's served me well in these situations and I think that I’ve been an asset to my groups of friends in these instances, helping to alleviate tensions and opening avenues of communication.","Standing on the precipice of life after graduate school is terrifying, not because I’m worried about work (finding it or making it for myself), or even because (like many of my colleagues) I don’t know what I want out of life.  I DO know what I want out of life, and the terror comes from an understanding that the structure of our society privileges a certain type of person to achieve it.  I know what it’s like to try and pursue a creative life outside of the academy, how the pressures of living make it more and more difficult to dedicate time, resources and physical and mental faculties to something that is often simply a labor of love, with little or no return.  I’m interested in the session Unthinking/Unknowing because I want to challenge myself to do just that. I want an opportunity to think differently about my creative practice.  How can I engage with it in different ways that don’t rely on what have become standard ways of making for me?  Collaboration with Ari is one way that I have achieved that.  In our own collaboration we ask how we can undo trusted modes of inquiry, use of critical texts and attachments to theory to become more articulate with ideas in an expanded realm of cultural production?  This session and the description of the process seem to be exactly the kind of thing that will help us do that. All of this and engaging in a critical community and building relationships across disciplines and geographic location are why we would love to attend SMT.  Timing is also important.  I am dedicating this year to pursuing residencies before having to buckle down and get a job.  July is when my new life begins.",,"Ari and I recently had our astrological charts read in an attempt to better understand our fundamental differences and how they impede our communication. During our sessions with the astrologer a strongly coincidental similarity in our charts lead to the possibility that we had a relationship in a past life which ended tragically and that the current difficulties in our relationship might be the result of this past life trauma. If we had enough money to pay for it we would hire a hypnotist to lead us through past life regression therapy in an attempt to better envision how this past life narrative might take form. Our interest is in the metaphorical potential of this narrative to shed light on the actuality of our lived relationship and on the macro level parallels that our conflict might have in contemporary society.  This closely relates to the theme of session B. Through this process we are working towards unthinking and unknowing our current modes of communication, stagnancy in our relationship, and to open up new and radical modes of relating to one another and the world.  We see the potential to reimagine the possibilities of both our friendship and our creative collaboration.","I often ask myself “why art?”  In a world where commodity fetishism and rampant neoliberalism rule the art market I wonder why it feels so important to do the work of cultural production.  In the end, I realize that it is because the inquiry that happens through the creative process is ultimately valuable.  That the questions that arise out of that process, and the process of sharing those questions and the tenuous and myriad answers that are sometimes produced, allow for different ways of thinking and hopefully, through a carefully articulated aesthetic experience, eventually, actual radical change.

",https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwWJsrIZNrpbQ2tsbkM4clh0Rm8/edit?usp=sharing,Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING),"I am applying in collaboration with Jaime Knight. I am an artist, writer and chef; I recently graduated from university where I gained valuable insight into the process of socialization through a series of powerful participatory examples and am now trying to unpack the notions I have about how to be a productive and socially engaging artist, human and thinker. My recent artistic practice has taken form as a multi-disciplinary investigation of collaboration, competition and support, whether in the physical, psychological or interpersonal sense of the words. I work from two basic methodologies: the first being a critical model that investigates how things are and why and its counterpart, a productive model that proposes and enacts alternative structures.
I am invested in the power of social organization and solidarity—the ability of human beings to build agency, empathize more effectively and effect change by speaking and acting with one another. I have been greatly influenced by the critical pedagogy of Paulo Freire and Bell Hooks and the social theory of Michel Foucault. From these writers I have gained valuable insight into the power of discussion as a tool for social liberation and fluidity, an understanding that informs the structure, content and form of my own practice and my appreciation of art in general. My recent work has been as diverse as building a functional sauna for a nascent artist residency in New Mexico, founding a pop-up dinner club that raises and distributes funding for underrepresented artists and facilitating discussions with my peers about the course of the art world and how we view our futures within it.
","I work individually about as often as I work collaboratively and place great value in the potential of conflict and difference to challenge my preconceptions and enable me to empathize more readily. My collaborative work varies in structure (some examples are physical objects, performances and interviews/discussions) and I do not necessarily seek projects in which labor and investment are equally divided (although this has happened in rare cases) but am open to a wide variety of ways of working with and learning from the people around me. I believe in the potential of art to act as a socially mobilizing force and, whether I work individually or collaboratively, value the processes, discussions, arguments and reactions that the work can engender over any physical product. I view discussion, education and collaboration as tent poles of my practice more so than any medium-specific categories and I am excited by the prospect of a residency program that is based on dialogue, mutual growth and education. ","While in residence at PLAND in 2012 my collaborator and I built a functional sauna to serve as a bathhouse for future residents. Rather than describe the work here I have attached a link to an essay co-written by my collaborator and I about the project:

http://notesonlooking.com/2012/10/take-a-sauna/
","While in residence at PLAND (Practice Liberating Art through Necessary Disclocation) in Tres Piedras, NM I lived in an off the grid trailer with my collaborator for three weeks. In addition to dividing the physical and conceptual labor of our project we shared domestic chores such as cooking, cleaning and maintenance of the space. The work we did while in residence became as much about the physical structure we were producing as the process of living and working with each other in an isolated environment. ","The notion of unthinking/unknowing uncannily describes a feeling I have as a recent undergraduate. Art school was a blur of rapidly expanding potentials. My capacity to envision what art is or could be grew exponentially, at times reaching a critical mass that made any forward movement feel impossible. Now, that framework of critical mining is gone and I feel as though I have woken up at the bottom of the shaft. The important work ahead of me is to climb out of this space with the attention necessary to unpack what I found along the way. I have been given a powerful gift of multiple perspectives and the deconstructive tools necessary to balance them but what feels most necessary now is to forget everything I have been told, drop the baggage and find a way to make the practice I need for myself and my community real. Doing this is easier said than done and I know I cannot forget. But I can change my relationship to what I remember. For me, to envision thinking what I do not know how to think means making tangible what I know I need but cannot touch. I have touched many things like it but they all belong to others and do not quite fit me. I know I want to build something that can contain and support a collaborative yet challenging and discursive space, something that is responsive to the multiple desires of those involved and is flexible enough to meet them. I know I want this thing but as of yet it is only an abstract conglomeration of other structures, a reaction to what has come before. In order to think what I cannot think for myself I need to unknow what I have been told to want.","I recently attended a participatory group dynamics conference the goal of which was to analyze the dynamics of those attending as they emerged. In this structure (known as the Tavistock method) participants, supervised by a largely inactively participating team of psychiatrists and psychoanalysts, are divided into groups and given no further instruction but to analyze their group dynamics in the “here and now”. I found this method enlightening and productive and would like to organize a “here and now”  session at SMT. This would consist of sitting together for about one hour and simply saying what we feel as it arises. ","Jaime and I recently had our astrological charts read in an attempt to better understand our fundamental differences and how they impede our communication. During our sessions with the astrologer a strongly coincidental similarity in our charts lead to the possibility that we had a relationship in a past life which ended tragically and that the current difficulties in our relationship might be the result of this past life trauma.

My sister lives and practices at a Zen monastery and while visiting her there I was amazed at the community that had been built around maintaining such a specific yet individualized practice. The monastery is in a beautiful location and operates as a resort for the summer. During this time the students work full time (in addition to their practice) in exchange for room, board and zen instruction, in order to maintain and operate the resort. This three months of work supports the monastery as well as two others for the entire year. I want a school and residency program that is based on mutual support and collaborative life/work that engages capitalism in a way that the participants find comfortable in order to sustainably support the practices and lives of those involved.

My name is Rebecca and I’m a multidisciplinary artist and designer who lives in Brooklyn, New York. You may know me from last summer when I started a project about visual poetics using images from Google Search by Image, madegreen smoothies and read a lot of Kenneth Goldsmith in the hammock. My time at SMT last summer not only was a launchpad for an important project I’m still working on and developing, but helped me refine the kind of artist and thinker I want to be and continue becoming.

My creative and intellectual practice has thus far spanned many different disciplines, scales, and modes of making (from sculpture to video to performance to design to image-based work) but my interest in technology and digital media, and in exploring the larger questions they raise, is one of the threads that runs throughout my recent work. Working on my project at SMT last summer solidified for me that this is a thread I want to continue to follow (both conceptually and technically) and helped inform my decision to apply to new media art graduate programs for Fall 2014.

At SMT this upcoming summer, I hope to build on the experience I had last summer and push it even further; make better work, speak up more, develop even closer friendships and have deeper conversations, go on more adventures. I hope to continue to open my heart and mind to others, to learn how to wander, and continue to stretch my definition of what it means to be an artist and a maker. 
","My creative and intellectual work is collaborative both in literal ways and more oblique ones. That said, everything I do creatively is fundamentally and deeply reliant on my engagement with other people. In certain modes of making, I work actively with a collaborator or collective in a shared process of making and thinking (such as in my work on RECAPS with my collaborator Martabel Wasserman, or in my design practice); other times, my work is more independent and self-driven but nonetheless informed by a dialogue with friends, peers and other artists and thinkers.

My most recent body of work, visually similar imgs, grew out of a project that I started last summer at SMT and the direction of the work (which is still constantly shifting and changing) was shaped largely by conversations and feedback and experiences that I had throughout the course of the session. I’ve been fortunate to have other opportunities to present the work among peers and groups of people, and each time the feedback I receive and the dialogue I enter into is incredibly useful and fruitful for me.

Lastly, research is an integral part of my practice, and I see this as part of a process of collaboration in the sense that I am joining a dialogue or conversation that already exists. 
","http://rebeccalieberman.com/visually-similar-imgs-books

In David Buuck and Juliana Spahr’s An Army of Lovers, two poets come across a plot of land. Their initial discovery leads them through a progression of dream-like spaces, in which the plot of land is “also an enormous food court…not just a food court, but also an outdoor rehearsal space…not a rehearsal space, but a soundstage for gigantic live entertainments.” Through this protean space, in which theater is a warehouse is a bunker, the protagonists inhabit a universe in which things become other things, depending on how you look at them. 

In the kaleidoscopic odyssey of these characters, I see many of the questions that drive my work. My interest in creating a vocabulary of surrogates and substitutions is a thread that runs through both my major bodies of work to date: Whitetail Deer, A to Z and visually similar imgs. Through these projects, I’ve engaged with formal questions around the semantics of materials and the poetics of simile. I’ve explored strategies of remaking and restaging to estrange familiar systems and objects, and I’ve used formal grammars of equivalence, where things stand in for other things, to probe the contingency of meaning. 

visually similar imgs, which uses digital imagery culled from Google’s “Search by Image,” currently exists as a group of artist books, a website-based image work, and a series of looped video projections. Gesturing at the seams of familiar technology, I use material mined from search results in which Google fails to match an image based on visual DNA. In these proliferations of “visually similar” analogs, images become material: shapes and forms, pixel topographies, histograms of the everyday. They take on the ability to shapeshift into other things—a scene from a sci-fi apocalypse film parades as a fiery sunset and a fluorescent hotel room—and in them, I see poetic equivalences among the nonsense. visually similar imgs attempts to articulate a digital poetics of search, in which a grammar of simile and substitution is formed from the internet’s detritus. Mute and fragmentary images are liberated from conventional structures of meaning and reconstituted as semantic building blocks, like words in a poem. A dreamscape unfolds across the pages of a book, and the browser doubles as a hall of mirrors where unstable objects endlessly mutate and multiply.
","My most recent communal living experience was this past summer at SMT during Session B. Cohabitating with the seven or so other participants – cooking and eating meals together, sharing space in the barn, taking walks, making spontaneous morning smoothies and leaf collages – was a wonderful and fulfilling experience that I think allowed me to make better work, at the very least because I was so happy. Support structures of family and friends and roommates are incredibly important to me, and I understand the balance of giving and receiving that they demand.

Prior to that, my most substantial cooperative living experience was during my last two years of college, when I was a member and resident of the Dudley Co-op, a 32-person cooperative house for Harvard undergrads in Cambridge, Mass. My time at the co-op was emotionally, intellectually and socially crucial to my growth as a person and as a friend and as a thinker. Within the broader culture of Harvard, this community was a safe haven for me, my ideas and interests, and my changing identity. It was a place where I made incredible life-long friendships, activated my own political beliefs and was exposed to new ideas and people that destabilized many of my most fundamental assumptions about the world.

Being part of the co-op also gave me an important and lasting lesson in intentional living that has to this day impacted the way I treat my space and my community. Daily chores were part of the routine, as were attending weekly meetings to make community decisions and taking on longer “stewardships” to oversee larger things within the house. 
","I hope to participate in the SMT Hike this summer because I’m interested in taking on an experience that feels new and profoundly challenging to me, both on a physical level and an intellectual level. I look forward to  having a creative and intellectual experience that takes place quite literally “in the field” rather than in the confines of the studio, or the pages of a book (though I imagine we’ll engage in those kinds of activities as well). 

Within the past two years, much of my making practice has become somewhat immaterial and screen-based, in a way that makes me long for the days when I made very material work (large-scale sculptures, woodworking and performance) and engaged my body in that process. Last summer at SMT when I was thinking about this, I became interested in the idea of a walking practice. I hope to see how that practice of walking might become or intersect with my practice (if only for a few days), and I’m excited to feel what it’s like to be present intellectually as well as physically. I imagine being engaged in this different way might deeply impact the way I think and create.

I also hope to participate in the hike because I’m interested in sharing an intellectually and socially intimate experience with a group. I look forward to the kinds of bonds that form and conversations that emerge when people are removed from their everyday structures and environments and placed into this kind of new configuration.
","I have many ideas for an immersive workshop or lecture to be given on the hike, but here are a couple. In the past few months, I’ve begun a meditation practice and so my first idea is to lead some kind of group meditation on the hike. It might be a sitting meditation (perhaps a Loving Kindness meditation, which is the kind I have been doing lately) or it could be a walking meditation, though I would have to look into these techniques a bit more. Either way, I think it could be a great group activity given the structure of the hike and the fact that we will be out in nature.

My second idea is to lead sessions of structured making while on the hike, that are instruction-based and short in nature. Some ideas might be:
-	Make an object for walking
-	Make a work at the scale of the hike
-	Make a work at the scale of a stick
-	Make a work at the scale of a small pebble
-	Make a work using text

I am patient.
I am not interested in being current.
I am interested in being present.
I listen to music obsessively and write about it actively. 
I like to listen emphatically and ask people sneaky questions in hopes of exciting or challenging them. 
Recently, I stumbled upon the thought that 'I love interstitial time and hate interstitial space'. At first, it was just a fun thing to say to myself. Now, I believe it to be intensely true; unavoidably so. Some of my writing happens this way.
Confrontation is not my forte, but I am working at it when it counts.
I wish that people of varying age groups would spend more time together. I value greatly the time and experiences that I share with those much younger and much older than myself.
I have begun to exorcise myself of the concept of linear time.
My friend Seth refers to me as a 'deep Pisces'.
In a recent letter, my friend Katie described herself, regarding the consumer anxiety resultant from her purchasing an expensive leather bag, as ""not a materialist, but super fucking aesthetic"". This resonates with me.
I have become interested in contemporary dance. Instinctually, it feels like a close sibling of the language arts.
I am about 6'1 and 200 pounds, barrel-chested. Someone once told me that I move through the world like a small person. I took it as a great compliment.
There is nothing I enjoy more than a colourful meal with interested people.","First and foremost, my practice is collaborative in the sense that the material it uses is language, and language is a massive and complex collaboration. I see it as a system of symbols agreed upon and shared by a group of people; language is delicate and full of imperfections. In this sense, my work is necessarily collaborative; it needs the support and understanding of others.

In order for my work to be witnessed in any way, the reader's (or listener's) vocabulary must meet with mine and intermingle. We may share common ground in regards to symbols, we may not; we may think that we share a common ground when, in fact, we don't (and vice versa). Because of this, my work is as much about the transmission of ideas as it is about the discovery and inspiration of new ideas. It is always a conversation.

Furthermore, my work is almost always borne out of the social experience. It is practically essential to my process that the subject-matter-to-be reveals itself to me through an experience 'out in the world', be it through participation or observation. I find inspiration in the way meaning moves in and out of language; the way conversations that happen subtly in loud rooms, the way words can bear great meaning without intention, the way banal descriptions of things can be taken as psychic metaphors. 

My writing is most often an attempt at encapsulating a social event; one that happens in a quiet flash, or one that reveals itself very slowly and in many places.

My writing is at once an accounting of and response to the curiosities of living as a social creature. ","https://soundcloud.com/alvin_row-1/a-reading-of-conditional

This is a piece entitled 'Conditional Performance' and it marks two important firsts for me as a writer:

It is the first piece that I wrote that necessitates an oral presentation.

It is the first time I've collaborated with anyone (editor's aside) on the composition of a piece of writing.

Because the creative process associated with it was, for me, new and experimental, I see it as an exciting yet somewhat flawed piece. I included it in this section not because I think it's my strongest work, but because it represents my willingness to explore as an artist and it showcases my budding interest in welcoming people into my process.

I began writing it, knowing immediately that it was an oral piece, but with no specific end in mind. When I was invited to read as part of the OBEY Convention (an outsider music and art festival in Halifax), I knew that this piece needed to be a part of my performance. After working the piece into a near-to-final draft, I invited my friends Cat and Jeremy (a politician and musician, respectively) to workshop it with me.

Immediately, the two found themselves comfortably at opposite ends of the expressive spectrum: with Jeremy overly drab and Cat overly dynamic. As we worked through the readings, I invited the two to help develop their voices in the text, to sharpen the piece, adding and removing phrases and inflections as we three saw fit.

As I eluded to above, I don't think it's an entirely successful piece, but I feel it offers multiple points of entry and a fair scope of my tendencies (good and bad). I am proud of it, unabashedly. I see the entire process behind it as a potential platform for work that I'd like to undertake at SMT.","In November of last year, I spent five days on an 'inquiry'. It consisted of a walk from Lunenberg to Halifax (roughly 109km) along a  trail converted from an old railway track. I undertook this expedition alongside a visual artist, an architect, a basket-maker and a thespian.

The intentions behind the trip were varied and mostly implicit. Each of us had spent time living in both locations so (to my mind) it was an exercise in understanding the mental and physical distance between the two places; a journey which we'd all made many times in ride shares or hitchhiking in the years preceding the walk. 

It also served as a time to reflect collectively on artistic ideals. We found walking such a distance together helped facilitate a free exchange of ideas, histories and concerns as well as meditative silences. With a full five days of uninterrupted company and commitment, conversation took on deeper proportions.

The days were spent pacing towards the city. Each night we camped alongside the trail, sharing duties surrounding fire and food preparations. We slept five to a tent for warmth. The mornings consisted of stretching exercises, some readings from journals and discussions of trajectory.","I feel that the themes and structure outlined in the Unthinking/Unknowing session are in perfect harmony with my current artistic fascinations. 

My most recent work has been focused on the instances in which language fails us. I understand these instances to bear a kind of freedom. Rather than being problematic, I see the 'shortcomings' of language as opportunities to engage with symbolic or associative meaning, to work through ideas that would otherwise be tangled in reasoning or issues of clarity. I am interested in playing with the way the mind accounts for incomprehensible language. I have been trying to write without concern from comprehensibility. 

Beyond that, I believe the social nature of the session will allow/insist that I explore more outside of the usual boundaries of pragmatic and poetic language. Early on in my development as a writer, I saw poetry as a mode apart from social instances; though often borne of social instances, I saw writing as a chance to speak outside of them, to speak free of the social restrictions of audience, time and space. 

Now, as I become more confident and immersed in poetic language, and develop relationships that allow for more open-ended, exploratory exchanges, I see that it is possible (and deeply rewarding) to bring that type of language into the social context (rather than the other way around). The more I experience it, the more I find myself yearning for social exchange, for intellectual exploration, that allows me to use language unfettered by pragmatism or social mores and to have that kind of language returned in kind. I see this kind of exposure as entirely formative to my identity as a writer, and I suspect that I'll experience it in spades during this session.",,"An even-numbered group makes a daylight trip to a lake (ideally on foot or bike). 

Upon arrival, the group is divided into pairs and designated either Onshore or Unsure.

Pairs then stake an area of the shoreline within sight but not earshot of the others.

The Unsure is then prompted to share with the Onshore an inquiry, fascination or psychic hurdle surrounding his/her practice.

The Unsure then swims a length of the lake (with option to break on the opposing shore).

The Onshore develops a response to spur the Unsure deeper into his/her inquiry and re-opens the dialogue upon the pair's reunion.

The Unsure repeats his/her swim with a new question in mind.

This cycle repeats until both partners agree they've reached a mental plateau, wall or divergence.

Once each group is done, all partners and roles are switched.

After this second round, and a period of contemplation/rest/discussion, individuals are tasked with developing a brief affirmation based on their experience in the exercise (with the suggested exclusion of the terms 'I' and 'you').

Once prepared, the group is divided equally amongst the two shorelines, and asked to pronounce their statements one after the other, across the water.","If you tried with all your might you?

I’m from Long Island, but I have lived in New Jersey for the past six years. I love literature, poetry especially. I like experiments with words and meaning. I look for art that feels as if it is revealed to me internally rather than added to me externally. I try to write poems and plays that make people feel like they are part of a common human experience (an experience that is more based in the idea of humanity than society).  I try to be involved in whatever local scene I can and to learn from the artists in that scene. I have lived in suburbs and cities for all of my life and I would like a different experience than that. I think writing a bio is difficult. I am both quiet and friendly. My writing has lately revolved around salt, skin, golden, and ghosts. I have been dreaming of dirty water for a year, but now it is becoming clean. Some things I like are: dresses, card games, hot sauce, succulents, Sheila Heti, dogs of all kinds, mushrooms, sweet basil, myths and legends, foxes, hauntings, idiomatic language, mistranslations, Austin TX, Heather Christle, blood vessels, Richard Brautigan, Roberto Bolano, Yayoi Kusama, tacos, my family, bays and sounds, shells and fish, how one road can take you to any other road, windows, the radio, and infinity. ","My creative practice is collaborative because my favorite way to write is through creative games, as well as because I often try to see how poetry can work with other art forms such as theater, music, and photography. Trying to create a kind of art that is not your specialty or that is outside of your realm of experience usually helps you to see your own art in a new and unexpected way. Playing inspiration and communication games with other artists and writers is a good way to shock yourself out of writing ruts (or any kind of artistic rut). I have found that artists of all disciplines work with a certain level of perfectionism and focus, and explaining your vision to someone else- how it is working, or not working, or how you have been changing it as the work progresses- helps you to clarify your own vision. I like to write based on clouds of ideas and I would like to do collaborative sessions that explore similar ideas in different mediums- even if the ideas are very broad, such as using an animal or a color or a local legend as a starting point, and then seeing where each person goes from there.  ","I think the chapbook that I have been working on is the work that best represents me as an artist that is fit for your program. The chapbook is called vertebrates, and is a collaboration with my sister- my poems and her photography. I wrote most of these poems with the feeling that one thing could be many things, or at least with the feeling that one thing could be something else. I am open to experiments with voice and form, and am extremely curious and willing to learn about almost anything. I think the most important part of writing this was how much I learned while doing it. It clearly doesn’t read as an academic or scholarly work, but to write these poems I first wrote pages and pages of notes on the meanings of different plants and flowers, Pagan and Roman symbols and history, human biology, different forms of reproduction, New Year’s traditions, and ideas about death, among other topics. I also took notes on various readings in nonfiction, fiction, poetry, and drama, and from studies of visual art. I am very curious and excited and interested in learning, and I hope this comes across in my work. I would love to be able to take this to the School of Making Thinking and have a whole month to work and learn in a new and creative environment. 

Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-3JMOVy-UR8NjFxdGdlM0NXWkU/edit?usp=sharing","I have been living with roommates for the last six years, so I am very used to communal living situations. I currently live with eight other people in a house in New Brunswick, NJ. I have lived in two houses where most of the other people who lived there were also artists or musicians: my current house (Jones), and my house from 2011-2012 (Fire Island). I also briefly moved back to Long Island while I was interning in the city, and very soon after that my house was destroyed in Hurricane Sandy, so I spent six months saving money, replacing possessions, and learning how to be a very polite guest. I know that communal living requires always doing the dishes, even if not all of them are yours. ","I am applying for the Between Nature and Culture: Reconstructing Wildness session. I think that this session will help me develop as a thinker and as an artist because it is a topic that I am extremely interested in and would like to explore more. I am a tame person who feels connected to wild things. I am very interested in animals, humans, bodies, and nature, and how they all interact (especially in ways that feel true to the feeling of being alive). I would like to gain a greater background and framework to write about wildness from. Also, I would love to have the sensory experience of being in the Catskills for a month, and to be able to leave having developed new associations and a new vocabulary for describing nature and wildness in my poetry.    ","The workshop/immersive lecture I want to lead would be based around texture, meditation, and poetics. I would want everyone to collect objects with different textures- stones, grasses, flowers, anything- and then to meditate while feeling those textures. During this meditation, I would like to discuss the different textures and structure/lack of structure present when creating works of art, how much of an influence environment has on creation, and how much control an artist has over the direction their work goes in after it has begun. Possible texts that I would use for this are “Invisible Architecture” by Barbara Guest, “Some Notes on Organic Form” by Denise Levertov, “The Poem as a Field of Action” by William Carlos Williams, the preface to Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman, and Madness, Rack, and Honey by Mary Ruefle. ","The workshop I would lead would be a foraging expedition led by someone who knows the Catskills very well. The Catskills are good for foraging- specifically for ramps, chanterelles, chestnuts, beechnuts, blueberries, strawberries, amaranth, violets, mustard greens, chicory, and dandelions. The communal foraging and eating would be followed by time for personal creation or reflection. 

Foraging is a practice that is in the domain of the very “civilized,” high-end culinary culture of New York, as well as the wilder history of the area. How can foraging be so completely civilized and wild at the same time? The same question applies to art. Art is a way to express both wild and civil feeling, and indeed expresses some of the most “wild” and most “civilized” ideas of our time and throughout history. Foraging for nutrients, medicines, and decorations also provides a jumping off point for thinking about how creations develop- how you combine what you learn from society and what you gather from the outside world with your own personal tastes to create something unique. A workshop on foraging and its associated rituals would work very well as a way to investigate the questions that the seminar focuses on.

I feed myself in two ways: First, I am a fellow in the Studio Arts Department at Trinity College. I advise seniors on their thesis projects, am a teaching assistant in Steffani Jemison’s Video Studio course, and install shows on campus. Second, I work in the Hartford Public School district, where I collaborate with high schoolers on murals after school and tutor recent immigrants in classes that include Engineering, Graphic Arts, Biology, History, and Civics.

In my studio I have been working between wet-paint, light, sound, and video to make ephemeral paintings. This performative process is documented in video and sometimes leaves behind still artifacts.The interactions in my work are alchemical, turning awkward mass into luminous gold. Occasionally I inhabit a character made from the materials in my studio, the focus of the lens, and the painterly metaphors of rap lyrics. She is an obscured ""video vixen,"" caught in the act of building the set surrounding her. Sometimes she seems pressed under glass. Sometimes her costume and figure disintegrate into pattern and light. Her studio is one stage upon which she can melt her own violent or tender experience of content and rhythm. She scratches this itch so hard that she peels back the synthetic skin of the image – only to find another layer of vinyl or Formica beneath it. In a moment of weakness she eats the ice cream she intended to paint with. A jug of acrylic paint slips from her hands and spills. She reaches for it, in a power grab.

I am still trying to elucidate the nature of this power. Sometimes it seems contained within the space of the screen, and sometimes it extends into the substance of inarticulate social interaction.","I am applying to SMT as one half of a collaborative duo with Samer Sabri. We began working together as undergraduates at Yale University, and together we have explored a broad range of ideas by creating novel questions, objects, and contexts. In the past, each of us has claimed “authorship” over works we have created collaboratively. We are ready to claim dual authorship, and to attempt to make unauthored works.

Samer has been a character in my videos and has helped me figure out how to situate the works in space during installation. My videos are highly visceral, and their placement in relationship to the human figure is not incidental. I’ve helped him think through computer games and produced the layout and the graphics for some of them. We maintain an ongoing dialogue which catalyzes every stage of our individual processes. We've learned to present ideas to each other at earlier and earlier stages of our creative process and have gotten used to thinking of the other person as the one who helps narrow things from a vast universe of possibilities, rather than the one who simply shifts the course of a work that had already embarked upon a particular path.

All of my work depends upon augmentation by others. When my collaborators come before the camera they are self conscious. I often set up a narrow space and set of gestures within which others may act. My lens captures the blank stare that originates from a moment caught off guard. Human frailty in a “glamorous” moment is what lends the work its humor and its tragedy. My practice is about timing. Sometimes it is rhythmic timing. Sometimes comic timing. My own beat falls into and out of alignment with that of those surrounding me.","The Work: http://ilanahb.com/UNTITLED-INSTALLATION-2012/solo
Password: SMT2014

I worked with Zimbabwean artist Rebecca Aston to make an interactive light installation at the Yale School of Art. Programming was unexplored terrain for me before embarking upon process that led to the work. It began when our personal ways of forming light in space collided. She was saw the code first: its ability to track and to mimic. I had been focusing on the ways light framed and tracked a body moving through space.

We responded to the ways individuals navigated space in the School of Art. Where was movement predictably directional? On the stairs. On which staircases were people in a rush and on which did they meander? We were privy to the spoken and unspoken collaboration of the students moving through the building. We projected light and saw what happened.

We tried to capture the hypothetical sensation of existing as silhouette in Hype William’s dizzying video for the crunk hit “Snap Your Fingers.” The result was a projection which tracked the shadows of people as the moved down the stairs with a rainbow of flashing colors that disappeared as quickly as they arose. The work blinded visitors as the moved up the stairs. All the while, the screeching, yet addictive beat looped endlessly in instrumental.

This project came to mind when I came upon the passage on “Collaboration/Individuation” on the SMT website. While working with Rebecca (and learning from those who encountered our work by happenstance), my own personal voice was articulated with new-found clarity. Collaboration simultaneously defined and expanded the boundaries of my practice. I believe this occurred because of a willingness to change directions in response to feedback rather than get stuck upon prior work and expectations. Our joint efforts were additive, rather than oppositional.

","When I was 17, I spent 6 weeks living in the Telluride House at Cornell University. The program was free. I lived with 29 students, reading theory, cleaning house, and finding our own voices. The course I took, “Caribbean Dialogues[.com]” was taught by two Jamaican art-historians named Petrine and Petrina. A key part of the program took place outside of the classroom, in the echoing victorian house we inhabited.

As high school students, we were responsible for deciding collectively how we wanted to interact with the academics we were given access to. We cooked our meals and had a say in how the program budget would be allotted. Some early proposals included spending all funds to fill a room floor to ceiling with ping-pong balls. All choices were determined during evening meetings which sometimes stretched 8-12 hours. We would vote, debate, and vote again in an attempt to reach a kind of consensus. We almost never slept, drifting in a fog full of new ideas. This experience cemented a belief in me that in small communities where mutual respect is a given, massive mistakes and grand triumphs are possible in small amounts of time.","One question posed by the course description excites me in particular: can we embody wildness? In many ways, it seems as though we create the wild. It is formed on every edge by the boundaries of what we deem ordered. And so, if it is we who make wildness, can we make ourselves if we choose to embody the wild?

My practice will benefit in several ways from SMT. The work Samer and I have embarked upon together can grow in an environment which does not place a premium on creation’s adherence to a specific discipline. The process-oriented nature of the session aligns with the way we work. Everything begins with conversations about a larger theme. Sometimes there are tangible remnants of these conversations. Sometimes all that is left is an immaterial lens through which new ideas can be viewed.

My practice will benefit from a process which seeks to let go of “self-constructs.” Many of my videos chart a kind of hyper accumulation of self-construction. I attempt to capture in the moving image the visual and emotional congestion which occurs when one is acutely aware of being gazed upon: so much so that the screen they stare out from becomes an endless mirror to posture in front of. I want to attempt to break this mirror, pick up the shards, and see what is reflected there. Perhaps in this gesture my work might find a new way to approach wildness.

Samer and I have written a purposefully porous proposal. The work we will do at SMT will be greatly shaped by the way others move through it. Where my work has previously been about pushing up against the hard membrane of the fourth wall, I would like to see what happens when it is pierced completely. ",n/a,"We are interested in the historiography of addiction and its relationship to notions of wildness. Is the addict one who has fully tapped into her inner wildness, or one who is completely submerged beneath systems of organization?

The perceived pervasiveness of addiction is seated in societal anxiety. People choose to cling to the trope of an autonomous self making decisions independently. Faced with the utter failure of this model, they decide that the only kind of person that exists outside of it is the addict, the one of with no control. They thus end up turning every possible tendency and desire into a potential or actual addiction.

We want to create a series of “addictive games” which will unfold amongst the community at SMT. Later, we will write “code from conversation”; computer games whose structure responds directly to the play as it unfolds.

The games will be inflected by the broken rhetoric of 12-step programs, and influenced by Halberstram’s notion of fruitful failure. 12-step programs frame addiction as an accepted and unilateral state of being. We will build a program that seeks to cure the anxieties framing addiction, rather than the addict herself.","Samer’s question for me: How can repulsion and attraction be polar opposites yet coexist?

A shivering, goosebumped fear spreads through me when I encounter certain patterns. It’s the allure of things that seem organic yet eerily ordered: shapes that remind me of cells reproducing uncontrollably. When I see a scary pattern, my mind returns to it for hours. I have to relive the experience, often sharing an image with people I know share this disposition. Google “Trypophobia.” Many people think trypophobia was willed into existence by internet hypochondria. For me, the fear is real, and so is the allure.",I foresee no conflicts with this summer's scheduling.,Rate my artist residency,I don't eat shellfish

I am currently a 4th and 5th grade math teacher in a Lebanese public school.

My technical background is in mathematics, theoretical computer science, and systems programming. I am currently branching out to web programming and writing games for my students, using the “game mode” they get into to teach them math.

I have been devoting a lot of energy to improving life and learning in my classroom. I’m always trying to see what my students see and steer them to what they need to see with the least amount of pain necessary. That means creating silly games, computer games, stories, or activities for new ideas to make sense.

Each day I obsessively break ideas, events, or thoughts down into their most basic components. This habit ties into my background in philosophy. I work in a circular way; meaning that I focus on patterns that are repeated across very different domains. These patterns often even end up appearing in the very structure of my thoughts about them, thus creating a motif akin to a fractal.

I write my philosophical ideas on a blog called “The Analyst of Random Things” (tartisme.blogspot.com), and I also write a blog on Lebanese and regional politics (in which I am very engaged)  called “A country of strangers” (acountryofstrangers.blogspot.com).

I am starting as a Business Analyst for McKinsey and Company in Silicon Valley next fall; I think that will allow me to continue improving as a communicator and a problem-solver. I am particularly excited about learning to conceptualize solutions to “systemic” problems because they are intellectually fascinating and they plague my region of the world.","I am applying to SMT as one half of a collaborative duo with Ilana Harris-Babou.

My philosophical practice has increasingly been centered around making sense of the work concepts-in-the-world are doing and how their almost illogical, absurd underlying structure functions. The world of quotidian thought functions much more within that shifting, polymorphous universe than within one of cleanly ordered, axiomatic definitions. I want to keep digging and try to understand it better. This process is impossible without conversations with people about how things become important, and it is in these conversations that I am closest to the structures I am constantly trying to unearth.","I was taken by the statement “Learning is an openness of one’s identity to other’s practices and projects” on your website.

For my senior thesis in Ethics, Politics, and Economics, I wrote about responsibility for structural injustice (http://bit.ly/MCxGAL). In short, structural injustice occurs when social relations (unfairly) advantage one group over the other overwhelmingly in many dimensions. Structural injustice is, in the vast majority of cases, outside of the control of a single individual or a narrow group. Ending a structural injustice usually requires some form of collective action.

In my thesis, I try to provide a good conception of individual responsibility for structural injustice; my solution is rooted in virtue ethics. I think this work represents me well because it emphasizes that the questions I focus on are questions that I mull over in my daily life and that I believe everyone ought to think about.

I also use several different ways of progressing through my ideas: Chapter 1, where I explain why a virtue ethical approach is ideal to solve the problem, is much closer to analytical philosophy, with definitions and arguments that are clearly stated and structured. Chapter 2, where I argue for the particular “virtues” I have selected - such as “putting background conditions into question” - I use what I call a dialectical approach. I also include frameworks and arguments from other domains, such as game theory and mathematics (pp. 60, 61, 62) or English literature (pp. 66, 67, 78).

I really enjoy making connections between and borrowing methods from very different disciplines and sources to think about a question that’s too “human” and multifaceted to be confined to one discipline or approach. Through my way of working, I can contribute to – and gain a lot from – being at SMT.","Last summer, I went on a backpacking trip to South-East Asia and Eastern Europe with my roommates from college. We’d lived together for the past 3 years, but this trip was a radically different experience. We were nomadic: together from the moment we woke up to the moment we went to sleep for 6 weeks. We had never been to most of the countries we visited, and had very little time in each place. We had to make decisions all the time: where to sleep, what to see, what to eat, how to respond to crises, how to get to the next place.

I think that we knew each other well enough that we knew when to delegate concerns to the right person and trust that person. For more difficult sticking points, my place in the decision-making process was to step out and refine – almost formalize – positions and objections to help the debate stay focused. We strove to find the most satisfying answer rather than the most satisfied victor. We learned to pick our battles and avoid nitpicking when not important or urgent. This trip made us all more patient and better at decentering ourselves.","I think SMT is the best place for me to get better at thinking across fields and methods. Working with Ilana has allowed me to realize that I tend to enjoy instrumentalizing mental content. I am often trying to fit ideas into a framework that includes a thesis, arguments, and counterarguments.

I would like to get to a place where I’m exploring with a wider scope of ideas without being constantly on the lookout for “the point” or “the right answer.” This is where the concept of the wild comes in. This concept poses a complex question: the “wild” is very often used to designate a territory that is foreign but also meant to be subdued; is there a way to “open” ourselves up to what we designate as wild without trying to “conquer” it?

Even if that means letting go of the concept of the wild, is there a way to access this territory while respecting its integrity? It seems to me that if there is one, it has to come with a complete change in our mode of consciousness; our mode of appreciating the world.",,"We are interested in the historiography of addiction and its relationship to notions of wildness. Is the addict one who has fully tapped into her inner wildness, or one who is completely submerged beneath systems of organization?

The perceived pervasiveness of addiction is seated in societal anxiety. People choose to cling to the trope of an autonomous self making decisions independently. Faced with the utter failure of this model, they decide that the only kind of person that exists outside of it is the addict, the one of with no control. They thus end up turning every possible tendency and desire into a potential or actual addiction.

We want to create a series of “addictive games” which will unfold amongst the community at SMT. Later, we will write “code from conversation”; computer games whose structure responds directly to the play as it unfolds.

The games will be inflected by the broken rhetoric of 12-step programs, and influenced by Halberstram’s notion of fruitful failure. 12-step programs frame addiction as an accepted and unilateral state of being. We will build a program that seeks to cure the anxieties framing addiction, rather than the addict herself.","Ilana’s question for me: Please provide an in-depth description of the sensations you felt during a time you were lost in the act of making.

Recently, I got stuck on the 6th problem of this online programming contest: https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/feb14. For 4 days, I spent all of my free time working on it. Deep in a black hole, I wasn’t weighing my choices. I pursued an almost visceral urge to keep trying, testing, and retrying. I became nothing more than this cycle of problem-solving. Only as I drifted into sleep did my sense of self reappear.",None,Ilana (my collaborator),I eat everything

Yet, I was uniquely drawn to visual storytelling in a way that was unheard of in my family.  I studied Art History in undergrad, and went on to work in art galleries in London, New York and Los Angeles. While in LA, I started taking classes from Judith Weston author of ""Directing Actors"" and directed some plays for her theater.  I was completely hooked.  I applied to NYU Grad Film, got in, and I recently graduated. In the last two years I have been scrambling to make money (those student loan collectors are relentless!), and to start a Directing career.  ","Filmmaking is, by its nature, collaborative - and thats the best part of it.  There is an electricity, when one crew members idea spark’s anothers and then anothers, and soon you are creating something together that is far more resonant than any of you might have created on your own.  That kind of interconnected creation is what drew me to filmmaking in the first place.","I’d like to show you my short film Crazy Glue.  https://vimeo.com/22425398

Crazy Glue is based on a short story.  Prior to it I wrote all my own films... but I got myself into a little trouble when I wrote a film about my family.  Though the film came out well (audiences responded well - I will never forget watching the waves of laugher as the erupted in the theater - it was a profound kinetic and cathartic experience for me) my father was displeased.  Since then I have had trouble opening up and channelling such truths.  I am not sure what makes me fit for your program, but I do know why I need a program like yours.  I want to open up again, and brave channeling the truth of my own experience.  Your residency feels like a place to take risks.","Every living experience I have ever had has been communal.  I have always had roommates - at one point I even lived in a factory loft with 10 photographers!  I like to laugh and I value the unintended interactions that are a part of everyday when you live with many people.  I like that a casual conversation around the toaster can spark a great idea.  When you live alone  you have to bring all the magic yourself.  Its possible, but not nearly as fun.","I am applying for Between Nature and Culture // Reconstructing Wildness and Unthinking/Unknowing because I am intrigued by both of them and well convinced that they could both do my imagination some good.

At this point in my Directing career my job is to write a screenplay that is a pure expression of my voice.  Squeezed in in the hours around my paper pushing day job, I fear my writing has become stilted, stale, a room in desperate need of an open window.  It lacks surprise.  It lacks wildness.  Its too full of knowing and lacks the essential unknowing.  

A residency with other artists and thinkers would help me let the magic back into my tired brain, I believe.  In my work I strive to delight an audience.  I don't think that is a frivolous pursuit.  Making sense and un-sense, if you will, of the world is the artist job.  We must reframe human experience in a way that enlightens it.  But to do so we must be channeling these thoughts ourselves - and that is why I hope to do a residency at The School of Making Thinking.  I love the idea of being in a place to run wild, physically and intellectually, and seeing where that takes me and my work.",,"Well, I would like to write, and interact, and write, and interact, and write.  I have a New England story in my head - but I need to get out of NYC and stand on New England dirt to give it space to be born.

I've also long had this idea of open air plays for a small audience.  For instance staging Tennessee Williams ""27 Wagons Full of Cotton"" on a back porch at dusk. I love the idea of an audience that is out in the weather - feeling the air on their skin in a really intimate environment, hearing the crickets chirp as the sun goes down, watching a beautifully performance of a well written text.  There is an intimacy in that that reminds me of sitting around the fire listening to my grandparents and uncles tell stories when I was a kid.  A primal storytelling experience.  In fact, instead of putting up a Williams play, what I'd really like to do is write a play for the occasion myself.  It'd be fun to even have it be a ""walking play"" where the audience has to, unexpectedly, get up and follow the actors into a field (where the play continues) and then into a cave (where it culminates).  Something like that would be cool.
","Why is storytelling important?

A story can, within minutes, plop us into the shoes of someone with entirely different life experiences and show us what the world feels like, looks like, smells like from their perspective.  More that anything else it can shift bigotry and hatred toward understanding and compassion in really unobtrusive, organic ways.  Storytelling teaches empathy, which is critical for a humane world.  it also shows you that you are not alone - that the root of human experience is similar.  Storytelling is also a vehicle for providing an audience with a little bit of magical thinking, which the drudgery of their daily lives might have washed away from their everyday thought process (thats my favorite part!)",None known at this time,Josephine Decker,"I try to eat organic and fresh, but I am fairly laid back"

",https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2594695/cv_feb2014.pdf,Session A (BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE // RECONSTRUCTING WILDNESS),"Hello. I'm Cassie. I'm a 31 year-old teacher, audio producer and multimedia artist. I live in South Brooklyn with my two dogs and my friend, Sarah. I'm originally from Madison, WI and lived there primarily until I was 25. I was raised by liberal hippies and decided I wanted to be a radio host after watching Molly Shannon and Ana Gasteyer host Delicious Dish on SNL. What great turtlenecks!  

Radio is my jam. I have been co-hosting and producing a live, queer, feminist radio show called Romantic Friendship for three years. 

I am also currently finishing up my M.F.A. in Integrated Media Arts from Hunter College. My thesis is an hour long radio documentary about my family's experience in an evangelical Amish mennonite settlement in northern Florida in the 1950s. It's an exploration into group identity, belonging, and the Amish values that live on in my family. 

For work I teach: radio production, new media, and journalism at SUNY Old Westbury, and robotics to elementary school students. 

I love to be outside and walk in the woods. I also like knitting very simple things, drinking beer, and making hand-made birthday cards. Most things are political to me and I like to have fun, sexy conversations about life and politics. ","My longest standing and most intensely collaborative project is my radio show, Romantic Friendship. My co-host, Sasha Wortzel, and I conceived of the project together three years ago, and have made all decisions around content, production and distribution together since. It is both challenging and extremely rewarding to work collaboratively on this show. There have been moments of frustration (and near demise) – but for me, the collaboration is what keeps the show going. It gives energy and life to the project. 

Being a live radio show, we are also collaborating with our guests and the community of hosts and project managers at BBOX, our radio station. 

I teach media production at the college and community level – and this is also a collaborative process. In this role, I am actually providing space and guidance for my students to collaborate with each other. I have learned so much about how to be effective in this role in the last few years. When I started I was way too hands-on, and stressed out about making sure the final product was top-notch. This distracted from my students ability to experiment and be creative! I feel much more confident now in respecting the process – rather than focusing only on the end product. 

Funny side-note, I opened my CV yesterday to update and upload, and remembered I had given myself the tagline “audio producer, teacher, collaborator.” Made me chuckle a little. ","Links:

In 2013 I was selected to participate in the Andes Sprouts Society residency, a program based on the idea of bringing artists and farmers together to create new ways of thinking about food, agriculture and the natural world. The main project I created during the residency was SOGS – a daily recording project that combined documentary and sound meditation. I also mounted a “Farmer Confession Booth” for our barn art show, and showed a short film about the foodways of my Amish-Mennonite grandparents – projected onto the side of the barn. 

As residents of the farm we also worked on the farm and at the farmers market. The combined experience of creating art and being part of a working farm community was beautiful and stimulating. 
","In 2009 I worked for the Montana Conservation Corps as a Youth Crew Leader. I spent many weeks out in the field with my crew, which consisted of six teenagers and my co-leader. During the day we build trails and fences, and at night we cooked, ate, played, did lessons, set-up and took down camp. 

What worked? Silliness. Unstructured time to balance out the structured time. Going to bed early so we could be alone in our tents. 

This was a particularly interesting communal living experience because of the gap in age and cultural background. One night it was my turn to cook and I made quinoa. None of them had ever heard of it before, much less eaten it. The next day everyone was pooping, a lot, and I became the subject of many jokes about poop-inducing hippie food. I wanted us to eat healthy out there, but in the end I compromised and started making pasta instead. 

I had a more traditional communal living experience living at a cooperative house with 32 other people in Madison, WI. We shared food, supplies, cooking, communal spaces and decision-making.","I am drawn – in both body and brain – to the “Between Nature and Culture // Reconstructing Wildness” session. 

Last year at my residency in upstate New York I tapped into a community of artists and farmers with strong ties to both country and city. As a native Wisconsinite – and someone who has spent their life canoeing, hiking, and chasing dogs – I feel a similar “pull.” And yet, I am learning to see these urges (to country and city) not as diametrically opposed, but as mutually constituted. They exist together. 

I tap into a different kind of creativity when I am in nature. My city self is frenetic and pop-culturey, fueled by a turbulent and productive anxiety. My wild/nature self is . . . more physical. Less scared. 

One thing that sounds exciting about the session is the opportunity to work with artists who work in more physical mediums – especially dancers and musicians. I have a background in both (from way back) and I wanna stretch these muscles. 
",,"I definitely want to sing, especially outside, and combine voice with environmental soundscapes. 

Also: feminist bookstores. Two years ago I started a documentary film about A Room of One's Own Bookstore, in Madison, WI – a place I used to work and one of the oldest feminist bookstores in the country. They had recently moved locations and doubled in size, at a time when feminist bookstores all over the country were shutting down. 

The story of this film is about survival, adaptation, and crafty/shifty ways of changing meaning and connotation through time. I'm interested in our narratives around natural selection – and how we apply this biological model to economics and society. What happens when we equate natural selection with capitalism?","What can chihuahuas teach us about our wild selves? 

People often think that my little dog is wimpy and fragile. He appears that way when he's walking on his leash in his little pink coat. But take of the coat and the leash – and he is a sure-footed little creature.

The following is a link to the video for my ""Safety Net"" performance.  Please note that it was part of a performance project and the video images start at 2:15.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-TiT29wr2g1WExNRXE2ZWJETXc/edit?usp=sharing",Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING),"My work revolves around portraiture, both of people and places, within the realm of community-engaged art.  I started out in this work of portraiture 10 years ago, when I left university studies and made a documentary about what it means to be an artist, from the perspective of 4 homeless men in Dallas, TX.  In the years since, I lived in Philadelphia and worked for a college prison education program that brings university students and incarcerated students together as peers for intergroup dialogue.  I was also teaching art in the Philadelphia jails.  I received a grant in 2008 for a portrait project in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia, using plants growing on the roadsides and lots of the neighborhood to dye silk.  I created a series of 10 portraits of neighborhood residents using batik, embroidery, and applique.  (Please see the Kensington Portrait Project on my website.) I will be exhibiting this work in Philadelphia summer of 2015, and will be collaborating with residents to design the exhibition.  

I moved to Toronto in September 2013 to pursue a graduate degree in Environmental Studies at York University.  My program requires that students create and fulfill research towards a self-designed plan of study.  My work is currently focused on how to intervene in cycles of social violence using arts-based approaches.  A main question of this work is how patterns of thought and action are maintained, and ways of intervention that can allow for new, yet unexplored, avenues to emerge.  My focus and realm of inquiry for this work is on group and collective-based approaches to social intervention.  My artwork in exploring this topic includes performance, video, textiles, and installation, with a focus on testimony and witness.  
","In my work in prison education, my role was to facilitate group processes and coordinate collective projects.  Influenced by educational practices of facilitation and curriculum development, my approach to research and artistic practice is oriented towards the creative capacity of groups.  My practice is community-engaged and oriented towards impact on social issues.  

My process begins with conversations, either individual interviews or group conversations, around a particular question or set of questions.  (A question I’m currently working with along with others is, “How can we understand social violence as a form of addiction, and what are markers of this historically and culturally?”)  From this collective dialogue and input, I work by myself to develop mediums and processes of exploring the topic artistically, and create a body of work in response.  Sometimes my individual practice is a form of research for understanding the question more deeply, and sometimes my own work enters back as working material for a larger group process.  The original question becomes expanded and deepened, and enters back into collective art production and exhibition or performance.  

It is an important way of learning for me to work with other artists, offering feedback or entering collaboratively into their processes.  I learn from the methods and mediums that other artists use and I see the process of working in community on individual or collective projects as exponentially enhancing each person’s growth. ","My most recent work, completed in December 2013, and to be exhibited at York University in April, is called “Safety Net”.  This work explores trust and risk in relationships.  In line with my process of working collectively, I designed a series of performance-based workshops exploring personal narratives in ways that asked participants to take risk in revealing and telling their stories in public settings.  Participants gave me feedback that the collective process allowed them to make actions and speak in ways that they would never have otherwise done, especially in public.  

I documented the group workshops from above in video, as way of gaining visual representation of how people choose to take risks in relation with others.  I then projected this video onto a wall and traced the movement of people through space using thread and pins, as a way of creating a more tactile and aesthetic sense of individual choices and collective movement around risk and trust.  I made a second video of this pin and thread process as a form of self-portraiture that then became the backdrop for a performance piece.  In this 10 minute performance, I kneeled on the floor in a darkened room in front of the projection and read letters about risk and trust in a personal relationship of mine with an incarcerated friend.  (Please see the link to the video work.) 

This work was a way for me to explore the potentials and challenges for collective work that depend on the willingness of individuals to trust and make relational risks.  “Safety Net” was also a way for me to take risks as a facilitator and artist, because I was choosing an entirely new way of working.  This was my first work of self-portraiture.    
","In summer 2013 I lived for 3 months with 12 other people at the Herb Pharm in southern Oregon.  This was an internship on medicinal plants, and involved farming for 8 hours a day, 4 days a week, and intensive evening and weekend classes.  As a group, we were responsible for cooking, cleaning, shopping, and organizing our household.  We all lived together in a large house with shared rooms.  Each person was responsible for cooking breakfast and dinner for the entire group 2-3 days out of the internship. 

I also co-facilitated a two week undergraduate study abroad program in La Paz, Bolivia.  For this project about 12 students all lived together in a guest home in the city and shared quarters and coordinated creative works amidst a collective living environment.  
","After working in the context of prisons and jails and in community-engaged art projects looking at how to address and change social problems, I’ve arrived at a line of questioning on how to intervene in dominant notions of reality.  I’ve been engaging ideas of systems thinking of late, and through this literature I’ve discovered that the highest levels of intervention in social and environmental problems is in changing consciousness and ways of thinking.  So far I've discovered that this requires the letting-go of control and allowing new arrangements of human, plant, and animal relationships.  Artistically, it requires a willingness for improvisation, and as “Safety Net” highlighted, a willingness to take risks on the unknown.   The Unthinking/Unknowing session seems directly related to my work and line of questioning about the role of art in social intervention.  

The residency will aid in my development by allowing me an extended time to enter into these conversations creatively, and allow me the space and time to explore these themes of intervention and consciousness through an embodied and collaborative process.  I think it is very important to work with others in exploring the question of how we think and how we take a leap into the unknown, since collective intelligence and creativity allows and provides for new ways of action.  I hope that that the residency becomes a space for me to create a project or small body of work that can enter into my work as an artist-facilitator with community groups.  
",,"I envision a project that involves the mapping of geographic landscapes in juxtaposition with conceptual maps around a particular topic such as “connection” or “interdependence”.  This project would engage collaborators in multiple interpretations of the theme in various mediums, including photo transfer of symbolic or metaphorical images, along with the cutting and rearrangement of geographical or topographical maps.  It might also include pictures and diagrams of plants or bodies in relation to each other.  Other mediums would include music and choreography exploring connection in time and space.  The final work would be an exploration of themes of interdependence that emerge from the group process around questions and challenges of social action.  The final exhibit would be an installation and performance venue, with the goal of offering new options and ways of thinking about how to define self in relation to landscapes and other living beings.  ","What is a map?

A map is a way of understanding the meaning of physical, emotional, and cultural terrains.  A map can show the body, the land, social environments, mental landscapes, and cultural representations of perception and reality.  Always situated within and exhibiting a social worldview, maps can show how people create and share meaning.  Stuart Hall speaks of “shared maps of meaning” or the representations of reality that people understand in relatively synonymous ways within cultural contexts.  Mapping can be used as a method of exploring notions of time, space, place, and identity.

","Session A (BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE // RECONSTRUCTING WILDNESS), Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING)","I am an academic and creative thinker. My PhD deals with 19th century photography and queer representation. My creative practice, as a curator, looks at queer history through contemporary art practices. As an artist, my creative practice needs nurturing and has been dormant for too long.

My PhD work is isolating, often resulting in working in a kind of vacuum. While in many ways it's part of the process, I am not convinced it makes for the best work. 

As a die-hard city dweller, nature is challenging to access. I live near Lake Ontario and spend summers reading, staring into the distance on an urban strand that simultaneously hideous and stunning. I long for the smell of nature, long walks and noticing small things in grass. ","I often work collaboratively. I've worked with Kelly McCray for many years as co-curators.

I've worked in performance, sound, film, and sculpture/installation, and am currently developing a film/installation project that revisions various narrative tropes from pop-cultural fictions and traditional fables, and explores the relationship between humans and mythological animals.

I live in the city’s west-end with my partner/fiancé and our rescue cat, Atari. I’m a vegan. I also have a day job as an office manager of a naturopathic clinic, which enables me to explore my interest in natural and alternative healing. I’m particularly interested in herbalism and metaphysical healing.

I’m currently reading 'Kafka on the Shore' by Haruki Murakami. My favourite albums released last year were Rhye’s Woman and Neko Case’s The Worse Things Get. I am also pro-Beyoncé.","In many of my past performance pieces, I’ve collaborated with other people as direct participants as well as audience members. Those performances often took place in the public sphere, and whether they were more participatory or solitary, relied on others to help activate these moments.

These days, my work has become less focused on direct interaction and more engaged with the possibilities of traditional media, such as sculpture and film. To that end, my collaboration with others has shifted mainly to that which is peer-based, through conversation where ideas are shared and feedback is provided.","mountains and hillsides enough to climb' (2003) was a performance wherein I ran an ad for four weeks in the classified section of the Montreal Mirror, a free alternative weekly, that read: SEEKING PEOPLE FOR 3-LEGGED WALKS.  I arranged to meet interested individuals in public spaces around the city, and upon meeting, we secured our ankles together and walked.  The walks lasted anywhere from1 1/2 to 4 hours.

Inspired by the 3-legged races regularly featured in my elementary school activities, 'mountains' sought to emphasize community over competition.  While during typical 3-legged races, each ankle-bound pair are cooperating in order to compete, the participants in a 3-legged walk are simply cooperating.  Removed from its original competitive structure, these 3-legged walks brought various strangers and myself together, cooperating for the simple sake and pleasure of walking.  Along with having to negotiate factors such as touch, stride length, speed, and direction, the insertion of our temporarily conjoined bodies into a familiar locale facilitated a re-imagining of how to aimlessly wander the city.

'enough to cross, enough to last' (2007) took place in Banff, Alberta, and was an extension of 'mountains'. For this performance, I solicited certified hiking guides to go on private 3-legged hikes with me. The hikes lasted 1 1/2 to 4 hours, and took place on various trails of different levels of elevation gain and intensity. During our hikes, the guides provided a verbal narrative of the trails we were on. Along with the physical challenges of navigating mountainous terrain while bound at the ankle, my intention was to complicate the assumed manner in which official tours of Banff trails were normally experienced, and present a form of new logic with the insertion of two temporarily and purposefully conjoined bodies in the landscape.
http://beckyip.ca/enough-to-cross-enough-to-last","I’ve spent some time volunteering on organic farms through the organization, WWOOF. One summer a few years ago, I volunteered on a few organic farms throughout Ontario with a friend. One of our stops was at an eco education centre in Eastern Ontario called Earthwalk. The centre attracted different people who arrived and left at different times. Some of us slept inside and some of us tented outside. Meals were prepared, eaten, and cleaned up together. Each meal took place at the dining room table. We would begin by choosing someone to select a card from the Angel Oracle deck to read aloud. Then, each of us would state an intention or reflection, and together, we’d give thanks before eating. This centre was also in the early stages of building an eco village about an hour’s drive north of where we were. We travelled to the village together, set up camp, and spent some time volunteering there as well.","I've always been interested in the interstices between official, unauthorized, and imagined narratives, and in exploring the ghosts of memory, history and place. In my current work, I’ve begun to explore plant and animal cultures, folklore, and symbolism as they relate to personal history and mythology. I’m also interested in the complex relationship between plants, animals and humans, and in exploring their implications in artistic practice and daily life.

A thematic and technical departure from my previous work, these current investigations are also informed by my own relationship to plants and animals, mythological and real. Participating in ‘Between Nature and Culture // Reconstructing Wildness’ would allow me to deeply consider my relationship to the natural world and wildness in all its forms in tandem with my relationship to my work. In investigating the possibilities of wilding and my inner wildness along with other participants in the Catskills, this session would facilitate a much-needed opportunity for conversation, contemplation, and instill renewal and wonder in my creative practice and development.",,,"If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?

My work has undergone the process of being purely representational to becoming phenomenological in essence, hence sometimes immaterial in its brief experientiality. I am after embodied research, walking being my prime methodological tool. My practice aims to find ways to communicate my belief that the process of thinking is yet another sense, and not the purely mental activity that rationality is understood as in our culture. It attempts to find ways of reuniting the body and the mind through work that is both experiential and intellectual in nature and reception.
I am interested in hybridity and impure systems as ways of survival and endurance —mainly as sources of sustenance. I find duality and established categories of subjectivity/objectivity to be at the core of Western culture’s inadaptability to the future on earth. I am searching for ways of being in the world that are less dysfunctional, both as an individual and within the social as body. My practice is geared towards building opportunities to nourish one or several of the means of experience a person has available to align, disalign, realign, that person’s patterns, including myself. It aims to find ways to attune to behaviors and find transformative ways to new ones. Lately I am focused on the process of being in nature and spending time with it as a learning possibility to enable behavioral awareness and change. I believe a critical/rational understanding of any given situation needs to be coupled with an experiential and embodied process. The benefits brought about by a durational exchange nature~human, while searching to understand this relationships from a non-hierarchical perspective, will allow a more balanced understanding and mode of being. I hope this therapeutic process will bring reciprocity to the relationship.
","I believe in the interrelatedness of all live and inert beings. In this sense existence is a collaboration between a particular space and time and a particular state of being within a dynamic system —all in constant flux. This engenders positive and/or negative, long-term and/or immediate, outcomes. Within this framework, and speaking only of intra-species collaborations, I collaborate daily with my family, friends, peers, colleagues, neighbors and fellow New Yorkers as well as with absolute strangers, aiming to have the scale lean towards the positive —nurturing the life aspect.
On the creative/intellectual side, as a process where 2 or more persons tackle together an idea from different viewpoints, working within a set of similar parameters and the common will to an outcome of sorts in mind —with partial or total effacement of individual authorships— I see my practice as highly collaborative. Formally and phenomenological I have consciously engaged in collaborative work with colleagues in walks, writing poems, and composing music/performances under the framework of indeterminacy and blind collaboration that Cage and Cunningham are well known for. I have also collaborated in a formal curatorial project for the exhibition “Notations, the Cage Effect Today,” and informal events involving communal walking, foraging and cooking (“What mushroom? What Leave?”). I am currently researching embodiment as knowledge generator in collaboration with an artist/preacher, engaging in field and theoretical research walks; and participate in a collaborative shifting group (IWT) for specific projects. I consider exchanging feedback about specific work —as in a studio visit— to be a collaboration of sorts.
Also I highly consider the visible/experiential portion of my practice to be collaborative in a dialogical sense, in that participants are invited to take part as conscientious performers where the outcome is dependent on the participant, yet indeterminate and open.
","PRESENT, 2008-09; MoMA PS1, NY.
During 9 months I sat for four hours at a time reading to myself (full list of titles here http://bibicalderaro.com/artwork/1426296_Present.html) and writing my instantaneous thoughts in a typewriter. I was searching for the roots of the financial collapse of 2008-09 in our economic system: Greek philosophy, the Enlightenment; reason as pure thought; reason as only possibility for thought and knowledge; ethics and epistemology. The writings were offered to the public as a gift, a copy of all typewritten pages given away was kept aside and later bound together in an artist book, and published in the paperback PRESENT. All typewritten pages are now an expanded poem that resides in the homes of those who attended the performance.
PRESENT is a multidimensional performed essay where I attempted to reduce the exuberance of thought to words; it’s a durational poem that gives thought a chance to communicate; it’s language as membrane and thought as sense; it’s a bridge between the left and right hemispheres, between the rational and the intuitive, between the past and the present, between form as stasis and form as a floating, changing dimension.

-WALKING AS KNOWLEDGE (text~walking), 2013, Bs.As. Argentina
This performance revolved around the reactivation of texts selected from Librioteca Pineal (http://www.ciacentro.org/node/1239). LP houses books about aesthetics, theories of perception, epistemology and environmental ethics.
Fifteen artists were invited to participate in a collaboration that was part chance, part agency, as we walked, read and interacted with the urban environment. The participants chose titles from LP to do loud readings at first sight within the group, in the street.
The weaving of texts juxtaposed with the street landscapes and changing neighborhoods makes walking a way of knowing as performatic process.
","My most recent determined isolated act of communal living was participating in the Walking Seminar, during the summer of 2013, in Puerto Rico.
The WS was a pedagogical experiment that invited 12 international artists to participate during 3 weeks of walking in PR. We walked out of San Juan heading East and South, camping at unspecified sites for 3-4 nights at a time.
The exposure to the intimacy and endurance of camping in non-campground places, without running water or bathroom, challenged the group in severe ways —many members had never camped before. As well, exposure to differing cultural patterns and language barriers made this experience an interesting mini-social laboratory.
Individual and group responsibility, ethics and trust are key components that I highlight as important elements in a communal living experience that thrives to engage the creative. The WS lacked the organization and transparency needed to allow or support these. Yet, my own personal synthesis of this experience recovers the incredible potential of camping as restorative and creative process —both at an individual and group level— while understanding the importance of a clear mission statement and the need for determined facilitation of leadership —or, again, the clear disclosure of its absence.
","My practice is based on the liminal spaces of the in-between —the gaps left by silence and non-doing— to understand processes of formation and transformation of body, thought and matter. I work on such fluctuating processes understood within the biological construct of the membrane as hinge, bridge, connector, to contextualize the production and categorization of knowledge and of being.
Currently I’m searching to make sense of thinking as another perceptual sense with which humans are equipped to experience and “know” the world. I’m also after understanding how being in nature can develop into a process of reciprocal attunement that facilitates changing old behaviors and/or inventing new ones, including that of thinking. Methods to create new patterns of thought and behavior interest me in particular, in the search for truly innovative ways of being in the world oriented to an ecology based on post-humanist ethics.

Thinking/not thinking and knowing/not knowing are fluid concepts that may happen in solitude yet may be enhanced by dialogic correspondences with people and environment. The process of communicating any such instances require at some point the need of naming; this use of thinking in its making is of utmost importance in my practice.
I would like to be able to further challenge this understanding as a methodology and pedagogy. Also, in practicing this understanding, I would like to help shape its theory.

Participating in this residency would allow me to collaborate with fellow artists and thinkers in this direction, while developing an understanding of differences that will make any theory and practice more robust. To engage in knowing/not knowing, thinking/not thinking, naming/not naming within a durational, immersive experience would immensely help shape the research I am proposing as a practitioner of art and thought.
",,,"How does a threshold shift/change?
Given that the world is a continuum in which we exist, I am only speaking of humans’ understanding(s) of the world.
The durational aspect of this question and its potential answer(s) make it difficult to establish one particular way in which a threshold changes. What interests me is the embodied nature of the dialogical self, how we embody experience from perceptions that become emotions and behaviors, into fabricating “knowledge,” sets of paradigms fixed to a given reality.
Walking in nature as method of realigning emotion/behavior/knowledge production into a dynamic understanding of sets may bring answers.

I think of my work as a construction of processes or encounters that mean to reach a state of questions. Through creating opened games that take participants out of their comfort zones, I experiment different possibilities of interactions with the other, what is around and the idea of intensity. These processes might or might not be documented and can take forms such as video, installation, performance, interactions, happenings and other hybrid ones. I was living in New York for that last 2 years while doing an MFA program in Fine Arts at SVA and just moved back to Rio de Janeiro.  I will have my first solo museum show in Rio this month, after winning a grant from Caixa Cultural. ","My practice is all about human interactions and does not happen without the other. In my pieces I have the role of a “proposer” or someone who sets up the parameters for the processes to happen, and these processes only happen when there are other people.

These are long silent interactions for 2 people (preferably strangers) with a specific space exploring the notions of spasms of life, presence, closeness and sleep.

Participants have their notebooks to communicate through writing with each other and have to stare at each other’s eyes for the whole experience. Thoughtfeeling workshops are not documented.

Also, I am very curious to be introduced to concepts by Deleuze, Roberto Freire and Paulo Freire in a non academic way.

The viewers could choose (consciously or not) where in the spectrum between sleeping and awake they would be. In the end they should write down any dreams they could remember that would serve for inspiration for the next event.

Initially, language seemed to be something secret. My father is a first-generation Iranian immigrant to the United States. My mother is American. Language in my household was frequently confused. My father’s first language is Farsi. Often, I heard Farsi spoken but I did not know how to access its meaning; I was not taught the language. Its sounds, unfamiliar and pure, were structured in a rhythm and pace that felt like a secret code. How do you access meaning if you do not know the code? 

The entanglement of movement and my creative impulses started to highly develop at age ten when I decided I wanted to be a modern dancer; I dedicated myself to serious study. I played the role of pantomime, reaching out to express while keeping silent. In my late teens, I developed anorexia and bulimia. 

Developing my illness and getting help was a realization that I did not know how to speak; I never had a voice of my own. During my undergraduate studies, I delved inward trying to find what was important to me. The answer came back to language and movement, but now embodying images and sounds. 

Working with the moving image is a complex process in structure-making and concept-building. I often think of my process as a form of collage. Ultimately, my work questions authority: who or what is visible/heard, and who or what is invisible/unheard. How do these positions create an in/ability of action? 

In Fall 2013, as an Iowa Arts Fellow, I initiated my studies at the University of Iowa in the MFA Film and Video Production program. I am exploring the moving image as a language, which communicates voice as a body of image and sound structures.","Collaboration appears throughout my practice in many forms. In one sense, there is the collaboration between my conceptions and the technology I am engaging with to manifest these visions. Experimentation with formatting, software platforms, sound feedback, etc require a lot of trial-and-error and manipulation of various tool sets. Working with equipment, keeping footage organized, and consistently locatable is a constant challenge I face and without digital technology I would not be able to do what I do. 

In another sense, when I am constructing a video piece, getting feedback from my peers and professors is an important ongoing conversation I engage with. This allows for an open forum of thought to be presented while also helping me question what I am making, really helping me see what is in front. Work can become difficult to read during the process of its making. Having a few voices you trust to help you sift through the mess of thoughts going on in one’s head is a great help.

Lastly, as far as working with another on a collaborative project, I am currently incorporating more hands-on multi-crew projects. Working in the theatre and designing sound for a stage play was a jump in another medium completely, but engaging with a community of artists who posed many questions to me to were looking for answers I could provide to shape an overall vision. It was taking what I know and applying it to the needs of the play’s text. Essentially, adding an elemental framework within a framework. At this juncture, I am working on a performance piece with my colleague Kasia Plazinska. Both of us have never done a project quite like this before, so we are building it from the ground up together each step of the way.","Human Body Battleground Organ Organism, 2013, 9m 30s, dv, appropriated collage

password: exhausted in this unfolding

The following moving image work was created in a self-directed production course during my first semester in graduate school, Fall 2013. As the title notes, the body is the subject matter of interest. But not a body we can easily define or depict a corporeal presence. More so, this body is a body of image and sound structures that begin in a state of declaration but reveal the fissures of language structures throughout its duration. The Human Body Battle—work demonstrates how a sense of playfulness, humor, with a heavy dose of biting subversion permeates my work. Here they blend together creating a voice, which instigates a complex set of questions upon the viewer rather than posing closed answers. 
Here is the synopsis: Human Body Battleground Organ Organism is an appropriated moving image collage investigating the penis and vagina as disembodied vessels. By utilizing a digital voice to enact this estrangement, a narration of declaration generates a questioning of definitions, where sound and image structures dismantle and reveal a deconstruction of audio-visual form and subject's signification.

Currently, this work is on tour with The Black Maria Film Festival. ","Every summer from the age 12-18, I participated in a “dance lock-in” with my fellow dancers. The lock-in was a mixture of celebration for all the hard work and effort we put into our dance training during the year but it was also an exploratory moment for us to creatively express ourselves by ourselves, to be the authorial voices of our choreographic jams.

Imagine, at any hour of the day for three days, collaborating, choreographing, goofing around, practicing and costuming a production number with your best friends. We were locked in our dance studio with no adult intrusion on our creative project. We were creating a dance production from the ground up. 

At the end of the three days, we had the showcase dance recital. It was a blast. This kind of communal living, even though temporary and for a short period of time each year, it was the event I looked forward to most. Getting to work together, be together, and celebrate our love of dance was very special to me and I understood that it was something not everyone got to do, to bond with those they deeply admired about something they deeply admired and live it together. ","I am most interested in participating in Unthinking/Unknowing seminar. For me, my art practice correlates to a type of unthinking/unknowing with each project I start. It is through my art making I explore a conception that I do not know how to decipher. It is only through the process of building, piece by piece, that any answers/resultant bodies of texts reveal themselves to me. Even though I predominately work on the screen, I am interested to further expand my practice to involve multi-media performance where the incorporation of my body, moving images and sounds will affect a space with which I am engaging. This seminar explores the unknowing body, movement, and thinking that is involved in my way thinking and making at the current moment.

I enjoy being able to use a more androgynous name because it fits my androgynous nature (or nurture). I bring up gender initially, here, because it is/has been shaping my work and life-questioning. Without going too much into social imaginary, I think that identity constructs are deeply rooted and mirrored by nature. Without an external social infrastructure, who would I/we be? a rock (genderless)? or a tree(maybe genderless)? or the heart of the forest itself? I would argue that identity or re-identity is summoned by spiritualization/reawakening/rebirth/revolution and the way I see it, you have to find that inside of the earth, inside of your skin. To sum myself up (right now), I'm into rediscovery, however applied, but I'm dabbling with ideas of collective re-identity as alternative education. And my favorite color is all shades of green. And I box on the weekends.","The genre that my work is most often categorized in is conceptual or performance art.  My aesthetic investigation always involves the human body and its interaction with other bodies, human or not. Most of my projects are collaborative in some way. I’ve produced a few projects that literally involve the aid of another person for the entire process from brainstorming ideas to prepping gallery walls. Though, what I find most interesting about my practice is that most solo pieces become collaborative in the final stages. I think that is a big distinction of performance art from other forms of live art, be it theatre, dance or otherwise. The audience participates, unknowingly or not, in the summation of the project. For example, a street intervention piece can be premeditated and conceptualized up until the point of performance. Then the window that has been left cracked open allows for the viewers/audience to alter the course of the work. A swelling crowd, a snickering adolescent, a snail or a frog’s unexpected interaction can change what is ultimately seen and interpreted through the lens of documentation.

A more explicit and relevant example of this happened during a project set in a remote area in the Georgian forest. The intention of the piece benefited from isolation to highlight ideas of reclusivity and fear. However, I was not actually afraid. On the day of the performance, a group of hikers stumbled upon my performance. The shock and/or fear (due to costuming) that became present from both parties had an effect and enhanced, in my opinion, the outcome of the piece. The link to this project can be found here:  http://amberry03.wix.com/portfolio#!trickster/cnvv
","This first link I've provided below is a project with brief description called Divided Actions. I think it reflects the conceptual nature of my work and examines some core ideas relevant to what can be imagined at ""A Summit on a Summit"" hike, such as mapping, wandering, and collaboration. The project was originally conceived in a class environment to then be ripped to shreds by Marina Abramovic in a studio visit. So we advanced the original project (following strangers as spectacle) to becoming invisible stalkers, think Sophie Calle or Vito Acconci. I liked how it turned out.

My second link below is another more recent project called iMapping (implicit mapping) that also involves following and mapping but hyper-focuses on the abandonment of social constructs. Like Divided Actions, I am following strangers but this time in a large metal encasement on wheels (my car). There's something about the protective shield that one's personal car can provide. In this context, it's a safety bubble. It’s an external, literal and metaphorical framework preventing my body/self/ideas from touching yours.  I give this project as an example for “A Summit on a Summit” because it is an extension of thoughts formed originally from the nature wandering in the first project I’ve provided, Divided Actions. And I’ve asked myself a number of times whether I consider the unknowing participants of these projects (the persons followed) to be collaborators. Essentially, yes, but it’s something I’m still chewing on.

","I would say that the majority of my adult life (post-undergrad) has been some form of communal living. And because of this, I've found myself often at the doorstep of family and friends that will take me in for short spurts of time. More specifically, during the past few years as a graduate art student, I've lived out of my car, had a run at living in a 2 bedroom city townhouse in Atlanta shared by 6-8 people, and crashed the majority of the time at a sculpture studio at my school (Savannah College of Art and Design). 

More appropriate to this question though, is my 6-week residency in rural India where a group of international artists shared a space that was an empty library--can you even call a library a library without any books? We were told it was a failed attempt by an ambitious NGO but nonetheless, the 15 to 20 mosquito nets gathered on top of individual decorated mats will paint my memory for years to come. As a supplementary note, chai was absolutely the connecting source for the residency, some would say food, or the art produced, but I say chai.
","I am applying for 'A Summit on a Summit"" hike for a few reasons. For one, I am interested in Guy Debord's or the Situationist idea of the derive and psychogeography. As an expansion of urban wandering, to wander within and among a sensuous landscape develops this solopsistic platform in the mind. I want to find and develop chaos here. I want to stumble upon and create order here. And more importantly, I would like to bare witness of this development with other thinkers. 

My opening-up process for discovering new ideas involves a liminal step-by-step process --which follows van Gennep’s rites of passage:  separation, transition/unlearning, reincorporation or reidentity. The process is usually in environments that border nature and civilization, like paths within forests, human-made grooves in trees. The process is often solo, so I question how the shifts in identity and unlearning identity can transfix and become valued as a group. As mentioned before, I consider my work to be collaborative in general but usually that collaboration comes into being at the final stages of production or during the performance itself through audience participation. But it has been atypical for collaboration to occur in the thinking process, the initial stages of conception. I'm curious to change/experiment with the process of conceptualizing prior to a project with other vigorous thinkers/artists. I'm interested to watch and interact with the blank stage in others' minds, and how they begin to fill that stage when actively engaging, moving with our **animate environment. Is it a replication of what is visually seen? Is it possible for us to see/envision/feel the same thing? And aiming towards the social realm of my practice, can our inevitable differences be processed in this way as post- ""ist"", e.g., racist, sexist, ageist. 

**Just as a distinction, I don't think I believe in inanimate things.

","My mobile workshop deals with fear as an inherent part of our identity and how it aids our understanding of rupture. 

Questions that help structure what rupture is and can be:
1) The physical body goes for days without food, how can you sooth that rupture? What is hunger in the context of this hike?
2) Light enters the eye through the cornea, what happens when the cornea is ruptured (lights out)? Can you imagine other areas for light to enter?
3) If a specific group, say the people hiking, is a concrete community ,what could rupture them/us? Do we fear this separation? What would bring us back together?
4) To me, the largest rupture of all time occurred as a nick of the skin underneath a mustached man whose prejudice initiated one of the largest atrocities of human history. A metaphorical nick, an irritation that erupted in hate-fever.  How do we bring that fever down?
5)Some symptoms of traumatic rupture are loneliness, anxiety, disorientation. Can we orient each other by disorienting ourselves? How?
6) Imagine fantasy without nature, what is it?

Potential exercise:
The act of eating is often a congregational meeting. We nourish each other through conversation and company while eating food. What changes when the act of communal eating is merged with the eating process itself? I feed her, she feeds me; she feeds him.  What changes when this process is used for one meal? Two meals?  Every meal? What happens when we skip a meal, when rules are ‘enforced’ in one of our basic needs?

",N/A,"Q: By engaging in alternative learning situations are we approaching freedom?

A: Do we attempt to rid of the institution, with its rigid lines and frameworks, its premeditated system of order?  Do we seek to demolish it’s walls to rebuild our own? Or to exist without a social structure at all (is that even possible and if so what does it look like?) Or do we simply seek an equal seat in the house? 

ARE WE SEEKING RELEASE OR ARE WE SIMPLY WANTING AN EQUAL SEAT IN THE HOUSE?

I seek release or I simply want an equal seat in their house.

www.singdearchild.tumblr.com",https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwurS1xGScw8eHkyek5PakZlcWc/edit?usp=sharing,Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING),"I am a performance-based artist living in Montreal.  Formally, I am trained as a dancer and choreographer, making embodiment the primary application in a practice that has become seamlessly interdisciplinary. My performances negotiate the real with the spectacle and target the psychosomatic using gesture, video, collected objects, slide shows, milk, love letters, tape recordings and most recently microwaves. I superimpose narratives of illness, consumption, the self and the feminine using a cross-referential logic of sign symbols. Either as a mantra or a mode of mechanical reproduction I find it necessary to repeat words, images and gestures over and over. Meaning is never the same but also nothing new is ever created. I enjoy this perplexity.

I value both those things that are understated, and those that are overstated. I search for a real feeling but I also like punch lines and entertainment. I consider performance mostly as a situation made up of signs, which include the people, action and that which we sense (see, hear, smell ect…). I look to create disorientation by subverting those signs. Disorientation allows for re-orientation and this is where we see the politics of performance. Politics are embodied. Lately I am interested in the economy of performance via the potentially assigned values of gesture. 

My days are made up of the following activities in any set of combinations:
Drinking coffee, running up the mountain, going to the studio, performing my ""waitress to pay the bills"" performance series, eating beautiful food and making love to my lover. 

I work alone but also in collaboration with the collective WIVES, performing regularly in various venues including galleries, lofts, theatres and music venues. Currently, I am preparing for 8-hour durational performance titled “digestion/liquidation” which will be performed in Toronto as part of FADO’s emerging artist series “11:45”.
","Firstly, for the past year I have been considering the performative situation, as one in which there is a perpetual reversal of power and vulnerability reciprocating between the audience and myself/the performer. I like to create situations where these empowered/vulnerable positions get thrown back and forth like a hot potato. In this way, opposites inform each other while equal meaning and value is ascribed to both. I need my audience and often ask them to participate by singing me songs, or closing their eyes while I make costume changes, reading the letters I give them, and letting me draw them. 

Also, I would say that my decision making process often depends on testing things out on peers and friends. I like to know how they respond to visual, textual and gestural ideas because I feel like potential meaning is collaboration. It could never be my doing alone. Meaning is created out of the collective experience of something. 

Finally, I work in close collaboration with the members of WIVES collective, to make experimental theatre and live and video performance. When we perform together we are one. It is quite indescribable but I will say that this state it is enabled by a certain quality in me wherein I allow myself to be lost completely into someone else.

This video, titled “yes”, features a mirrored image of myself committing the repetitive gesture of slapping my own face. The gesture seems violent at first but through repetition attains a certain ambiguity and meditative or therapeutic quality. This image is accompanied by subtitled dialogue between the identical images. The two selves both ignore each other’s statements and finish each other’s sentences. The “conversation” is rendered into an elucidation of something unspoken. There is no specificity, only sentimentality. I am talking both to myself and to someone not present. For me this work responds very specifically to the School of Making thinking’s summer residency on UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING because for me it occupies a space that I will potentially never understand. I am thinking but it is not yet a thought in a way that the thought may be a thing and furthermore in the way that a thing-thought might be understood. For me linking a gesture or movement disembodies the text. In a sense it disallows the text from attaining any finite or concrete meaning. It this way it proposes something entirely outside our thoughts. 

https://vimeo.com/81539404 
This is a video documentation of installment 7 of my performance series called “i feel sick”. It was performed outside the AGO in downtown Toronto as part NXNE ART in June of 2013. I’m selecting this work to include in my application because I feel it represents how I offer my gestures to others/the public in a way the gives them lots of space. I am definitely present yet unimposing. This signifies to me moreover, a certain kind of calm reflection I do through action and in dialogue with others. 

","In 2010 I moved to Guatemala to work with adventure tourism project. During this time the project (made up of myself ,another leader and 3-5 participants) would spend half the week, for 8 weeks in the highland cloud forests where we would hike up to a camp with all our food and sleep in tree houses. Every morning I would teach yoga to everyone. We cooked all of our meals over that fire and hiked to water spring for our water. The project would then spend the other half of the week in a village where I would coordinate volunteer programs to teach art and English to children.

In 2012 I moved to Joshua Tree, California with my partner who was working on a earth dome building project. There I cooked meals for the 6 builders. My partner and I slept in one of the 3 small ‘pod’ domes on the site. In all we were 7 people living on a 2-acre plot of land, sleeping in a combination of domes trailers and tents. We had electricity for a small part of the day when we turn the generator on. 
","My keenest interest in the session theme is in the application of philosophy to somatics in a creative structure. One of the goals of my practice is to find a quality or type of movement/gesture that is embodiment of it’s own meaning; movement that does not create meaning through representation. I am interested in creating movement that moves freely through the entirety of the body but is still actively ‘real’ and in so responsible to the situation around it. I imagine a readable pedestrian gesture that gets swallowed by a dance vacuum. My intuition tells me that a way towards this is through creating a unique logic that responds to a specific mind/body inquiry –such as “how can we think what we don’t know how to think?” Likewise, the question could be changed to “how can we act/move/gest what we don’t know how to think?” That being said I think the topic of the residency is absolutely appropriate to help me direct myself towards this particular creative objective of mine.
On another note, I feel my practice would benefit tremendously from the open and communal structures of the residency. When I create a performance it is often for a particular context, with a particular audience in mind. It is very seldom that my creative impulses arise solely out of themselves and have space to develop organically. I often feel like I am making a show and I would like to, during the course of the residency, explore questions instead.  


",,"Given UNLIMITED FUNDING, I would build a large glass pyramid in a field. The pyramid would be large enough to house about 10 people. In this rectangle these people would be executing a choreography of independent and partnered gesture, centered on the task of putting thumbtacks in balloons and blowing the balloons up. Culminating into an endurance performance, the performers would fill the balloons until the space is full from floor to ceiling. Some of the movement involved in this performance puts the balloons at risk of popping –especially if they blown up to maximum capacity. There would be a live recording of the space that would be broadcasted to the outside but re-mixed in via programming to play in super slow motion. I would install cameras inside the space (gopro cameras maybe?) and would later edit the performance footage into a video, in such a way that a narrative might be suggested between the performers and the space.

Whether in stillness or in movement, the body is the most accessible, intimate and tender medium through which I learn. Lately, I have been learning through a desire to embrace some of the tensions and contradictions (felt most viscerally in the body) between the wild and expansive nature of the imagination and the material realities, histories and political context within which I find myself. I am currently exploring ways of using these tensions as a means for creative resistance and transformation. 

In tandem with this curiosity around tension comes my attraction to language as a medium of expression, learning, healing and growth. I love the process of pressing up against the rigidity and limitations of words; the release within a structure. I love investigating, disassembling and unraveling words, and delight in watching them form on a page or tumble out of our mouths as if of their own volition. I love feeling contained by language, and using that container as a catalyst for discovery. 
","Whether I work alone or in direct collaboration with others, I understand the entire creative process as inherently collaborative. Every element, every image and idea is somehow informed by, and infused with, the infinite sources of inspiration that emerge from everything around me that is alive: the people, insects, trees and sunlight. Beyond inspiration, I am joyfully indebted to the constructive criticisms and feedback from those with whom I share my practice. This is instrumental in keeping my work authentic and alive.

There is also the magic that I experience during moments of collective presence in performance. I treat my role as a performer as one which cultivates a space of presence, establishing contact and provoking invitation into the realm or reality created in the performance space. So I see the generative process of creation as well as its product as constantly collaborative.","One of the more recent tangible manifestations of things I have been feeling/thinking that relate to the SMT, and especially the “Between Nature & Culture” theme, is the research, writing and exploratory exchange I have undertaken since last Fall. This is centered in learning through a few Indigenous women’s writing of prose and poetry as a means of sensitizing ourselves to the connections between the body and land. This work emerged out of a course I took on Indigenous Traditions, Women & Colonialism, and continues to spiral out in various forms of research, writing, and embodied experience. 

This project has served an ongoing process of experimentation with the use of language as a tool of invitation into experiential learning. In this way, I have been exploring and sharing how words can work both to maintain as well as subvert colonial ways of thinking and being. 

So far, this project has taken the form of a paper entitled “Beyond a Fear of the Wild: Reading Indigenous Women’s Writing on Body & Land”, which I will share on a panel on Indigenous Women and Resistance as part of Concordia University’s “Study in Action” conference in March 2014. It has also expressed itself through in a week spent in meditation and observation under a tree in Oaxaca, Mexico, as well as in my poetry practice. 

*In lieu of providing links, here is the abstract of the paper I am referring to, if you are interested:

This paper is an invitation to awareness. It emerges from a framework that considers historically masculinist, colonial worldviews as contributing to an ongoing culture of violence, and understands decolonization as a gradual and ongoing process. In sharing this work I will begin by briefly bringing forth a couple of documented examples of the disconnect between body and land to shine a little light on some of the language used for the purposes of the colonial project. Next, I will show how some Indigenous women are resisting and destabilizing colonial beliefs through teachings centered on the interdependent relationship between the body and the land. As a process and living practice of unlearning colonial worldviews cannot truly manifest through book reading alone, these teachings act as an invitation to an embodied process of un-learning; developing a sensitivity to the dynamic exchange between body and land. Their work asks us to consider how we relate to the land, and the material, psychological and spiritual implications of such a relationship. I aim to show how learning through these writings can contribute to a process of sensitizing ourselves to our environment, facilitating a moving away from colonial worldviews and towards communion with the land through a relationship of reverence and respect.","Communal living has taken several forms at different moments in my life, and right now it is through a shared living space in Montréal with three humans and two furry creatures. We share bulk dry goods and recuperate fruits and veggies, make kombucha and communal meals when we can. We share hand harvested honey, reading materials and plenty of nourishing kitchen floor conversation, and have developed several functional systems for division of labour, as well as financial and material contributions. We have a compost system using vermi-compost in the house and bringing organic waste to the collective garden that some of us work at during the growing season. 

Every week we hold a meditation and listening circle where we light a candle and sit in silence, followed by a check-in, and sometimes experimental singing, playing or fort-building. We also have a small stuffed spotted owl who we take turns hiding around the house to develop observation skills and awareness of space. "," I have been hungering for the space, time and support to synthesize these seemingly separate practices of yoga asana, meditation, poetry, academic research and writing, and performance. The nature of this course is so closely in line with the work I have been doing that I got this incredible rush all through my spine just reading the description! 

I feel that I will deeply benefit from the exploration of narrative through story telling, as this is central to my work and life, from the body-centric learning that I know can happen through slow play, and the insights and sparks that performed discussion can ignite. 

I feel a deep need for the space and collaborative support that this residency has the potential to bring, as well as some time to sit, run and play in the woods/grass/dirt/wind. It is the learning that comes through awakened receptivity to the messages of the body and land, and that exhilarating tension between form and freedom found in intentionally creative, collective space that I seek. 

The aspect of “wildness” is of special intrigue to me, particularly with a consciousness of the dominant and colonially constructed division between the body and mind;  rational and irrational; masculine and feminine; civilized and savage. I have been finding myself experiencing small flashes of insight in the readings, discussions and thinking I have been doing about this, and see immense potential for deepening, complicating and expanding that learning through this residency session.  As my creative practice is a necessary element in all of my learning, I also recognize potential for a more seamless integration between this practice and my more formal academic explorations. ",(Only applying to Session A),"Session A: Between Nature & Culture

I would love to create a performance that uses the language and sound of poetry to generate embodied movement. Through this, I wish to bring full, living expression to my poems as living entities occurring always in a particular context with a particular group of people. The process of writing, speaking and sharing poetry has always emerged through my body, yet has not come into full expression in performance; meanwhile, the body-centered work and play I have done has often lacked the tangible synthesis of language. My sense is that I have less a need for money or material resources as much as the intentional space and support to more fully realize this merging of creative practices. 

I do not have specifics in mind yet, but envision a series of poems, either new or re-visited, performed in an embodied, gestured manner, and in dialogue with those present. My understanding of such dialogue implies direct contact between “performer” and “spectator”; the holding of space and guiding of a narrative arc that facilitates collective release. What I mean by release involves a connection to the breath and a relaxing of the diaphragm, and happens at the moment in the performance when everyone is together at the same time- often through a shared exhale or laughter. ","Q: What can you offer to a collective learning process?

A: Through training and experience as a yoga teacher, educator and workshop facilitator have allowed me to develop a strong capacity to hold space and actively support individuals’ particular experiences. I have come to recognize an ability to facilitate this process while allowing full agency and autonomy of the person I aim to support.","I don't foresee any scheduling conflicts as I intend to commit to the full three weeks, even if this will mean not participating in other opportunities.",From my dear friend Adriana Disman and attending the Brooklyn fundraiser in February!,"I prefer not to eat most meat, and have no allergies."

Photography is my primary medium but I also work with video, sound and sculpture. 

My work is driven by an enthusiasm for small or mundane details in the world around me that are overlooked by others, hence my fascination with dust. Dust is all around us and all things become dust. Some of its largest components are human skin and hair, though it contains other surprising materials like star dust. (For more information on my dust project have a look here at my website here: www.sallybozzuto.com/#!dust/cyuu)

I'm also fascinated with things that fit into the following categories: terrifying, gross, amazing. For example: teeth. Teeth are a part of one's skeleton that is seen on the outside of the body (terrifying), they are covered in bacteria and saliva (gross) but they are also necessary for our survival (amazing.) With the exception of nanomachines picking our bodies apart molecule by molecule (grey goo) or maybe marshmallow fluff I think most of the things I can think of that fit into The Grand Three categories are biological in nature: babies, bacteria, dirt, carniverous plants, etc. Most things about the human body fit into The Grand Three if you think about them for long enough. The human body and its relation to the larger life cycle is one of the key elements of some of my newest work.

I am also an excellent conversationalist and have an absurd love of puns. Some of my most recent pun work includes my idea for this year's Halloween costume: a narwhal-mart greeter. Think: smiley face logo with a tusk and fins. ","As a photographer and videographer I am always collaborating with others. This takes on many forms: brainstorming sketches and ideas for a project with other artists, interacting with models or subjects, getting feedback on works in progress or working with a crew, especially in the case of video-making. 

I think one of the great advantages of working in a residency setting is to get feedback from other artists and thinkers and to have exciting conversation that can spark new ideas. I especially love talking to artists working in different media or people with expertise in other areas such as writing, philosophy, science etc. I think dialogue is one of the most precious and important elements of the art-making process.

How Can You Be Alive You Growths of Spring? addresses regenerative cycles of life and death using substances such as dust, compost, the human body and plant life. This work stems from a fascination with the complexities of biology and wonder at the improbability of life generating and regenerating itself in endless cycles.

Using photography and video I document real and staged processes such as bodily refuse mixing with decaying vegetation to create compost or plants growing from unlikely sources.
 
My work toes the line of attraction and repulsion by showing things such as death, decay, and bodily refuse in an aesthetically appealing way. I am also addressing the relation of seemingly contradictory forces. Decay begets new growth, birth begets death and death begets rebirth. The cycle is terrifying, repulsive and amazing all at once. It is my hope that this work fills the viewer with a sense of wonder at the incredible regenerative nature of life and stimulates deeper contemplation of both life and death on a larger scale as part of an endless, cosmic cycle.

The aspects of culture surrounding The Wild are of particular interest to me as I think this is something that could be explored much more in my work.

My life has been filled with adversity and isolation, so I consider dreams, fears and anxiety to be extremely valuable parts of human experience.  Much of my belief system has developed through a continuous dialogue with a sister who shares my DNA but not all of my experiences.  My work and interests are easily traced to the use of this dialogue as a tool for measuring the validity and value of our adverse experiences and emotions in regards to survival within society.  I do not believe adverse experiences should be treated as invaluable and often I feel there is an attempt to eradicate them along with a skeptical dialogue of our culture in education.

Because of the isolation that I experienced growing up, it became imperative to think outside of “reality” in order to survive.  This has both positive and negative aspects when trying to keep this quality and participate in community and society, but it does require the seeking out of companions who function this way as well and there is some magic in it.  I have always created art in intellectual gatherings of friends, and past dialogues and dreams have led to my current work and goals.  In my animating, I am literally working with others and must access my relationship resources in order to complete them.  My most recent film incorporated live actors who acted in stop-motion with my life-size, Frankenstein influenced, self-portrait.  My upcoming show will incorporate the help, art, music, support and input of dozens of people.  I find that along with the experiences of my twin sister, I am often trying to pull from the experiences of others to find overarching themes that hopefully lead to modern, visual mythologies and enhance the spiritual value of my life and the lives of others.

Also, please look at my website.

Recently, I have spent a lot of time reading, researching and thinking about identity, the idea of the individual, epigenetics, nature and nature, the work of Charlie Kaufman, the philosophies of Ludwig Wittgenstein, the problems of technological determinism, and twin symbolism in art.  ","All but one of my living situations have been communal.  I have lived with probably a total of thirty different people, including my grandmother.  But my most interesting experience was probably sharing a room with my twin sister until the age of eighteen.  Although we have lived apart, we were never separated by more than a few miles until I moved to New York to earn my M.F.A.  This was extremely hard and frustrating.  My sister and I have been through everything together and most of my immediate family would agree that if it had not been for our relationship, our collective situation might be far more adverse than it is.  I struggle always to find something that matches that relationship, but I know I never will.","""How can we think what we do not know how to think?"" is a question that creates probably one of my favorite black holes to fall into, and I feel it is a deep thought spiral that is related to all the thoughts in my brain, feeling often outside of myself and separated from reality, not ever knowing when I am thinking like ""myself"" or how much control I have over what that is.  Because of this, I love dreams, all talk of them and looking for synchronicities between my life and the lives of others.  I hope to find realities that lie outside of what I expected or thought, but I feel that I have to train myself to be open to this and aware enough to notice what I want to incorporate into my artwork and personal value system.",,"With the funding and time, I'd love to share my experience putting life into puppets through non-electronic kinetics, stop-motion, and electronic servos.  I think with the time, it would be interesting to bring characters to life and create improved, collaborative film by having others build their own self-portrait, stop-motion characters and interact with the characters of others in an unplanned, collaborative way. ","Does technological determinism allow for individual control over the necessities of survival?  Wittgenstein: ""Just as a man cannot report his own death when it happens, but only foresee it and see an epic description of a whole culture, you will have to look at the works of its greatest figures, hence at works composed when the end of this culture could only be foreseen, because later on there will be nobody left to describe it. So it’s not to be wondered at that it should only be written in the obscure language of prophecy, comprehensive to very few indeed.""",None,Internet search,None

At the moment, my work (as well as my life) is informed by the tension I feel as a university dropout who is deeply engaged with critical theory. I have a background in physical theatre and movement work, and I really don't know what I make yet. I read voraciously. I go to conferences and tell everyone I'm finishing my PhD in Lisa Robertson and the feminist poetics of waitressing (lies! But I prefer to call it performance art). I know how to work with my body in impulse-based, strange, raw ways. I've read everything Lauren Berlant's ever written. I can mine my chilly northern Manitoba upbringing for all sorts of inspiration - digging graves in snow as a lonely third-grader at recess, lying on my bookshelf for hours pretending I was Anne Frank, polar bears, my mother's depression, etc. I find psychoanalytic theory delicious, feminisms necessary, Montreal dance parties utterly weird and generative. But ugh! I don't know what I make.
","Adrienne Rich: ""I wanted to go somewhere the brain had not yet gone. I wanted not to be there so alone"". Lisa Robertson: ""So what if she is thick and stupid behind her life. It is not private"", and also, ""She wanted to tell about it but not necessarily in language"". Lauren Berlant: ""the emotional time of being-with, time where it is possible to value floundering around with others whose attention-paying to what’s happening is generous and makes liveness possible as a good, not a threat.” 

I'm a compulsive archivist, I've read fucking everything, and my friends are crazy and brilliant. I don't know how I would survive without the glut of quotes I've sought out to validate my curiosities, tensions, alienations. The theory that fascinates me is fundamentally about relations and subjectivities. I want to know how we survive and how we survive together, I want (always, always) to create work that stands as a testament to the aggressive, sometimes hopeless genius of the friends I’m lucky to know. I write as the daughter of a mentally ill, hyperliterate mother who gave me her copy of The Madwoman in the Attic to read at seventeen. I work as the granddaughter of a Jewish Marxist woman who could spin off Atwood references at the drop of a hat but could not, would not, stick around town long enough to begin to mother her children.

Why are my loved ones in such turmoil? Why are they so articulate and yet so anguished? I hope this doesn't sound too heavy. I come from a mad but hilarious line of folks. My family does the best bleak humour and I mean to carry on the legacy, but at the same time I wonder, with Anne Boyer (the best poet, my favorite poet): ""Who will care for the raped but brilliant thinkers?"" (Mother, friend, friend, aunt, friend, fucking hell when does this shit end?).","http://hysteriarama.tumblr.com/post/16572083925/self-identify-as-a-hater

This is a tumblr post that I wrote a couple of years ago. I tend to believe that I generate the best, richest life for myself when I dredge up the space to puke my anxieties into some sort of public sphere. At the same time, I don't really find that terror and abjection livable in an ongoing sort of way, so I'm continually trying to find ways to shape my raw material into questions and frames that others can enter and exit consensually. I'd like to invite participation and collaboration without coercing it, or, as one of my genius friends and I discussed recently: ""We've got to translate our trainwreck selves into art and theory or else we're doomed to a lifetime of   being well-read, inarticulate girls who cry publicly far too often.""","I spent a year in my hometown (the frigid-but-secretly-grand Winnipeg, MB) living in an anarchist collective home with eight other folks. We were the Winnipeg Copwatch Collective, the Winnipeg Radical Cheerleaders, the punk house with the best tickle trunk in town. I learned so much about anti-racism, about the politics of policing, about the soul-sucking dullness of house meetings, about being naked (also literally, we didn't like to wear shirts) with roommates and letting them see the spaces I didn't have theory for, didn't have quotes for, found scary and vulnerable and wanted to hide. In our collective house it was impossible to remain hidden, and though that scared me it also broke me open in the best ways. As an only child who grew up with a single parent, communal living is deeply foreign to me, and therefore both scary and exciting. It's my favorite challenge to undertake. I'm also totally on top of doing dishes.","I began taking theatre classes as a three-year-old, and only recently have I taken a break. I'm sick of this break. Physical theatre also throws me into a tizzy because it inevitably undermines my ability to falsify my practices. Life becomes sincerity or bust. I end relationships, eat better, wash my face early and read on mountains. Physical theatre always reminds me that, though I may be a hyperliterate theorist-in-training, I am also an embodied thing. Affect theory (and Deleuze, ooh baby) goes hand-in-hand with this work. When I am moving, engaged relationally, and theorizing my becoming rather than theorizing what I've already become, I morph into the most human, most productive version of myself. Juliana Spahr: ""An attempt to reach the human moment will occur"". All I'm ever trying to do. All I really give a shit about. The session theme seems so human-moment-heavy, it makes me feel totally lustful.",,"I hated university so much, found it so unbelievably dull, and yet inevitably find myself longing for structured educational spaces, albeit ones that don't require so much alienation from oneself. This is the tension I'd like to prod in my dream project. How do you perform your thesis? How do you embody your fragmented poetics? Last year I co-facilitated a lit collective named CWIRL (crazy women writing in real life, we all met on tumblr so we though the irl part was hilarious, and the crazy women part was a seventies feminist throwback). I'd like to remount a miniature version of CWIRL. I dream of facilitating a collective school-process in which we read Adrienne Rich, Lauren Berlant, Lisa Robertson, etc etc etc (and believe me I can fill in the etc) and begin to indulge in our feminisms in a new way. I'd like to theorize the Belantian impasse, the time lived without a genre, in a way that accounts for my being a waitress, a depressive, a girl who has watched every episode ever of Law and Order SVU. (This is vague. This question terrifies me but I know that with a bit of support I could rock it, live it, make it possible).","Q: Hey baby, what are you wearing?

A: Glasses, dangling on one finger. Filled-in eyebrows, aching shoulders, jeggings (which I feel ambivalent about). A body from binge-eating, the other night, when I was talking to my mother for hours about the nature of her life on an icy reserve in northern Manitoba and the nature of mine in cold, throbbing Montreal. My Jewish nose. My bad skin which will just not not not un-bad and which forces me to re-encounter skin theory, rupture, imperfection, I wear this shit on my face and I have to find a way to make that livable. Long hair that I spent years growing out after I chopped out the desexualize and rehumanize myself, post-feminist-fatigue, feeling so sick of being vulnerable in the ways that girls tend to be. No bra. Smartwool socks that my father mailed to me because the one way he consistently cares for me is this super pragmatic, warm foot technology way. It's a limited love but I'll take it. I'm going to put on a dress now and go dancing. Xoxo gossip girl.","No way! If I get the chance to join you this July I am so, so, so there. The only scheduling conflict is that I probably won't ever want to leave.",From my friend Adriana Disman,"I'm easy. As long as it's basically healthy and tasty, I'm in."
3/1/2014 22:55:38,Evelyn,Walker,iwasevelyn@gmail.com,(812) 532-0090,iwasevelyn@gmail.com,United States,"Bloomington, IN",11/14/1990,cargocollective.com/evelynwalker,https://docs.google.com/file/d/0ByQZn5GHnHDyVFJ1M2lRUTdLVTA/edit,"Hike (A SUMMIT ON A SUMMIT), Session A (BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE // RECONSTRUCTING WILDNESS), Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING)","
My current body of work is a collection of object-based circumstances that incorporate and activate the viewer. The viewer is changed from viewer to participant and even an active plot driver. The object is changed from passive subject of observation to a complex character. In this way the hierarchical barrier between viewer and object falls away, activating both the viewer and the object as characters of equal force. 

The narrative happens episodically, with main characters who appear as puppets or dolls. Rather than existing on a stage or inhabiting a fictional plane, the puppets inhabit the real world: getting haircuts, writing notes to human acquaintances, dying and being interred, or inciting a grave digging. 

Events unfold organically and genuinely, and I as the artist often take on the role of character rather than master puppeteer. The lack of total control serves to tint the unfolding events with honesty. It reminds us that though what is happening in these pieces is the language of the lunatic or the trickster (a part of the mind may choose to hang back an laugh at the absurdity of accusing a puppet of a crime), it is at its core as real as the human experience. Fellow human characters participating in these events observe how they feel compelled by the circumstances, and even by the puppet characters, to feel and react in a way that is surprising, unplanned, and genuine. 

These  “circumstances” are a part of a larger, perhaps interminable epic. They are an intuitive narrative that asks questions about the agency of objects, the authenticity of intuition, the human condition as character in play, manipulation and perception, and the defining qualities of what is real. 
","My main practice is at it's core dependent on collaboration. The circumstances defy the separations that traditionally exist between reality and fiction, artist and viewer, art work and real world. Much of what the work becomes is due to its existence in the mind of the participants. They act not as viewers of an object, but actants in a series of events. Thus my work is arguably always a collaboration. 

Aside from my core artistic practice, I also participate frequently in collaborative efforts, such as event planning, group exhibition curation, and collaborative art projects. Most recently I completed an artist book, designed, illustrated, and crafted collaboratively with artist Mike Calway-Fagen. I am currently organizing a puppet slam, for which I've invited a number of individuals from various artistic backgrounds, as well as non-artists, including scientists and environmental activists. These creative minds are coming together to both invent and produce an alternative puppet performance that will challenge given power dynamics, starting with expectations about puppetry. In this way, the work will both directly and indirectly challenge far reaching and basic assumptions about the human place in the universe. ","The circumstances surrounding Fabro's Funeral represent two separate situations, each of which were a part of an ongoing epic. This work involves a dependency on the voluntary participation of others, a perpetual call and response between the people and objects involved, and the importance of moment to moment involvement. It also embodied a search-based approach to content, and revealed a richness of substance as events unfolded. The piece is not preserved in crisp documentary photographs, but in snapshots, and in the minds of the participants involved. In this way it is both un-preservable and ongoing, embodying the spontaneity of hear-say. The piece involved questions about life and death, reality and spectacle, and humor and sincerity, but ","I have lived on an organic farm under a work-trade agreement. During that time I exchanged 15 hours a week of farm labor for living space in the farm house. I became personal friends with the entrepreneurial farmer who initiated the project. I have also lived with 2 or more room-mates while living and working through school. Each living arrangement has focused on community building, including cooperative cooking and meal-sharing. During my time in Bloomington I have had a close association with the Bloomington Cooperative Living community, and have hosted events for the benefit of the living community as well as participating in the meal-share program. ","My work has become increasingly interested in challenging accepted power-dynamics and structures. This manifests primarily in the process of work making rather than the content of the work itself. The art-making process begins with impulse and through a self-aware openness (or perhaps relinquishing of self) discovers the subconscious richness of events. This seems to be consistent with the mission statement of the School of Making Thinking, and I am happy to have found an establishment that claims heurism as it's central maxim. It is because of this self-same center that I have applied to all three programs, but with a special interest in Unthinking/Unknowing, which seems to speak to the heart of my work most directly, but also seems to be applicable to a broader practice outside of the residency program. ","My work is centrally interested in allowing the spontaneous to unfold, which is one of the integral focuses of the hike. I'm also very interested in non-homocentric perspectives--that is to say, the investigation of the universe that does not place the human at it's center. Ideally I'd like to craft an experience to take place during the hike that allows this perspective to be fully experienced. This may focus on the environmentalist value of ""bio-centrism"", but it may also be related to the broader view of ""selflessness"" in its most deconstructed and broadly applicable form. ","I have up to this point enjoyed drawing from an attitude of resourcefulness, relying on the appropriation of cast-off and discarded items. I find that this practice brings charged objects to the work; objects that carry their history and character with them. This is almost stubbornly low-cost at times. Given unlimited funding, I think I may still choose to work in this way, re-using items that are obtained without cost as a rule. Funding, however, could be utilized in this situation for transportation of items typically more difficult to obtain. This might create an interesting opportunity to engage and examine the process of transport in all it's dimensions: its economics, it's environmental impact, and it's effect upon us as objects in a constantly shifting world. ","What is the usefulness of a question? Maybe the usefulness of a question is not as  a formulaic approach to the acquisition of understanding or a fortification of a belief system. Rather, the value of a question is the experience it offers: a question is an acknowledgment of doubt. To acknowledge doubt with no hurry to resolve it is to embrace uncertainty, even to invite it as an artistic medium. ",I do not at this time have any scheduling conflicts.

I’d like to sail around the Earth. Up until recently, I thought I was an artist, one that happened to enjoy adventure, map making, self-directed science experiments, and cataloguing curiosities. Once I realized I was not an artist I thought I was an explorer, one who happened to enjoy making videos, writing, drawing, and photography - see where I’m going with this? On the second last day of 2013 I bought a twenty foot sailboat and realized I was both an artist and an explorer. I am currently negotiating what it means to be an artist who expresses through the medium of exploration, and how to create work for presentation via exploration.
","I am drawn to The School of Making Thinking because of its approach to collaborative work. As an emerging artist, I find sharing ideas extremely intimidating. I’m easily embarrassed and I often sell myself short because of it. After reading SMT’s ideas on collaboration/individuation, I am convinced that it’s within this community structure I will find my ideal form of collaboration that will allow me to break from being self conscious, and instead learn to embrace the vulnerability that comes with allowing your ideas to move from mind to mind. I am motivated by group discussion, and glean insight for my own projects while observing peers critique each other. When working in a group on one project, I sway more to the side of a follower than a leader if the final product is going to be something that requires interpretation, however, if the project is something literal I feel more comfortable being vocal with my opinions. I believe this is rooted in the insecurity of not believing in myself as an artist, and my struggle of self-identifying as one. 
","At one point in my life I thought I was going to be the first person I knew personally to go into space. A popular daily paper promised to send someone to space - all you had to do was ask and get the most votes. I thought if I made a video to accompany my request I’d be chosen for sure. I was not. That said, I still plan on being in space at some point in my life. I wouldn’t describe this as the work that represents me best in relation to being fit for the SMT program, but it showcases my enthusiasm and ernest disposition when working on projects that excite me. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAggD8qoi4I
A work in forever progress that is more aligned with the SMT program is Rambler, currently a blog with zine ambitions that I post long winded stories and photos from adventures. Rambler as printed matter is my first work that will marries my artist and explorer spirit in a medium that is tangible. http://www.ramblerrambler.tumblr.com
","After film school I went to art school in Vancouver for a year. To save on rent, three friends and myself found a 10x30ft windowless studio to call home. We had no cell phone reception or internet, we occupied the space with books and discussions, slept on pullout couches, and ate food from dumpsters near school/meals provided by a nearby temple. There was a public toilet on the floor that we shared with a dentist office and pharmaceutical company who would never find out we lived there. During the day we had to pretend we were working, by night we would take over the halls to make music, art, ride bikes and skateboard. We found the balance in creatively challenging and emotionally supporting each other.
Two years later I lived in close quarters with five other people as we sailed from Halifax to Spain on a 53ft sailboat. Before setting sail, we spent a week on land living together. We made meals, shared our fears, and on the final night we sat in a sauna taking ten deep breaths as a group then jumped into the Atlantic as one. At sea we were all accountable for each other’s life.
 ","I believe that Between Nature and Culture// Reconstructing Wildness is a program that given the opportunity, would remedy my dilemma of the artist vs. explorer struggle. The focus on group work is an element that I know is missing in my current practice, and with the aid and critique of others in a safe zone for sharing, I will be able to let go of many self-doubts that hold me back from currently making the work I conceive. 
The session Unthinking/Unknowing is something that on a basic level I have been trying to achieve since I left school. It’s something that I think everyone should be working on, but it’s difficult to know where to start. For myself, and I believe it’s this way for a lot of people, the idea comes as a feeling, then the unthought-thought comes to the surface, and from there without instruction, it has no where to go and I’m back to thinking what I am told to think. 
Challenging oneself to formulate ideas and concepts through more unfamiliar territories, such as intuition and unconventional learning allows for one to develop new modes of thinking, and expand their creative process within their own work.
","During the “Summit on a Summit” hike I would like to lead a workshop in telling time (during sunlight) and direction (at night) by natural indicators. I’d like to explore as a group the dichotomy of a sunrise, vs. a numerical time of day, or the position of the stars vs. a number value or name for a direction. These are both man-made structures that it’s difficult to imagine life without, however the natural world is existing without these things. I want to have a discussion about what this means; to comply with something man invented, in this case time as a number, but to know that it even with this system in place, the phenomenon of a sunset knows no time, and is existing regardless of what time your clock says. Man’s invention of time, vs. the Earths rotation around the Sun happen simultaneously, I think there’s a lot that can come from this observation, especially on a hike, and the romanticisms of losing track of time and direction. ","With unlimited funding, I would create a space that would serve as a site-specific Museum of Natural Imagined History. The project’s intention is to challenge fact vs. fiction in nature and promote discussion on what the general public is willing to accept as scientific truths or myths. Often we cite what’s published as truth without question, but sometimes after years of further examination, we find these truths of the past become modern-day myths. I often find the myth is more alluring than the fact, and as an artist I’d like to explore this idea further and ask the participants to immerse themselves in a world that is based less on scientific “theory”, and more on the Ancient Greek word “theoria”, which means “a looking at, viewing, beholding”. ","If asked by Mars One to be one of the 24 explorers sent on a one-way mission to colonize Mars, would you go?
Funny you ask; that question’s been on my mind. I believe that space exploration is exciting and important, and to be one of the first humans on Mars is an incredible opportunity. However, I believe that we owe it to Earth to focus our energy on causes that will protect our natural resources, resources that are essential to our existence and that are not on Mars. So no, on principle I cannot help you colonize Mars.","If a bee stings me I will have to go to the hospital, but promise to return promptly.","Sophie Traub, I believe you two have met.",Meat.

3/2/2014 3:35:29,Lasha,Mowchun,lashamowchun@gmail.com,2049967493,lashamowchun@gmail.com,Canada,Winnipeg,June 30 1989,http://vimeo.com/user6901463,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hyT6OZxQNljKIKVdBMdAhNJxZNtgwmXu16BDjc2F0Hs/edit,Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING),"My name is Lasha Mowchun and I would position myself as equally thinker and artist. I wanted to be an artist from the time that I was very very young and thought that I would be a painter. After several unsatisfied years as a painter I found myself looking at my paintings and wanting them to move, to speak. I felt frustrated with the silence and stasis of the gallery experience. I felt critical of Fine Art more broadly, because I felt that it was often inaccessible to the broader population and that the institutional galleries reproduced the marginalizations which were in broader society. I wanted art to be something which was not confined to the gallery, which was able to reach out and uplift pieces of society which were not within the art world. My frustrations almost entirely dissuaded me from realizing my childhood dream of being an artist. Instead of giving up I tried to put my criticisms to work in a productive way. I began to theorize relational aesthetics and participatory art as a way of breaking the divide between audience and artist. I became interested in film because it is a media which has permeated deeply into both high and low culture and which is therefore available to a broader audience. I use my camera not only to fuse narrative and aesthetic concerns but to respond to social inequalities and philosophical questions.  After many years of making films, I do not believe that I will ever completely answer my questions of institutional power, hierarchy and populism through my media. Instead I do not look for answers but seek to remain sensitive and open. I try to let my questions continually to reformulate themselves which forces me to reformulate my media and aesthetics to respond. Giving up painting was important for me because it taught me that being open to change allows opportunities for unexpected transformation. 
","I think that people are not the authors of their own thoughts because our sentiments are the furnishings of broader ideological forces. In this manner all thought is collaborative, because meaning is created within a web which extends beyond the individual. In my practice as a filmmaker I see my camera as a relational entity within which this ideology has been inscribed. 
I believe that filmic works whether artistic or commercial exist in a dialogue with the broader ideological forces because film is a mass artform, which serves not only to entertain but also to control, to govern and to design our representations. I am interested in responding to these ideologies, whether they be consumeristic, political or social within the medium of film because I see it as a site specific interrogation. 

The practice of making a film is inherently collaborative as it is created by many individuals in a network. As a filmmaker I have had to reach out to many communities I was previously unfamiliar with. In advertising for actors on the internet, meeting crew members who are willing to work for free, or in exchange for my work on their project I have extended beyond myself. The subjectivities of these many collaborators are then integrated into the content of the project itself extending the ideological references beyond those which I have personalized.

 Particularly through my use of non-actors in dramatic roles I have found that identity is not an expression of self, but a performance of ideology. Someone who is not a trained actor has not learned to unpack their concepts of self and when they play a character they surface. I want to access these surfacings because they are the runoff of glacial beliefs systems which mould the individual. As someone who has acted in my own films, or had my close personal relationships translated into narrative I have been fascinated to watch the strange formations of ideology surface. 

Collaboration has been essential to my art practice because I think that my work is more relevant if it is challenged by forces which are beyond my personal sentiments. I have written many of my projects in direct collaboration with other artists and invited strangers into my editing suites. I like collaboration not only because of its philosophical qualities, but also because I like to feel stimulated and challenged by other people. 
","I am applying for the Unthinking/Unknowing seminar between July 1st and 21st because I am interested in questioning my preconceptions, working in collaboration and ultimately approaching thinking as concept. As an example of my relevant work I will provide my most recent film, entitled the Excruciating Beauty of Melody which considers irrationalism as a form of anti-knowledge through we may gain clearer insight. I would like to provide a link to the film and recommend that because the film is 25 minutes long, if the jury only has a limited time they watch from 18:00 forward.

Inspired from a real delusion, the film follows the life of a young man who believes that his body is becoming a musical instrument. The score is of the film is his personal soundtrack- a piano which begins to haunt him, at first from the distance and then moving closer, until it is inside of him. This film was loosely based on a story from my family which has been told and retold, detailing a schizophrenic episode which my Uncle Elroy in which he believed that he could play the piano on his teeth. I had been fascinated with this story for years and as I came of age as an artist and feminist particular themes in this story began to interest me. The music which Elroy heard, elicited from his body seemed to be a unique way of knowing the body which is outside of the confines of gender. I believe that sexuality has been narrowed through the binary system of gender, which covers over the hidden meanings of the body and narrows the pluralities of identity. My Uncle Elroy had a girlfriend named Laura during his formative experience with schizophrenia whom he still talks about today, 40 years later. I sought to portray this music as a form of anti-knowledge, which helped both Laura and Elroy efface their gendered knowledge of their bodies and move into a unknown place in which they might allow the hidden meaning of their bodies to surface.
","I currently live in communal housing with two other artists. Together we share a house which was built in 1895 around the time which my hometown of Winnipeg, Canada was being settled. I find our home to be a source of personal nourishment and inspiration. Together we form a micro-community which connects to a larger constellation of art, thought and radicalism in the city of Winnipeg. In the past I have had communal living experiences through living on intentional communities in both California and Oregon. Both of these communities were on eco-farms where the community grew and harvested their own food. ","I am applying to the Unthinking/Unknowing residency because on a fundamental level my art is fed by theoretical practice and I am interested in exploring this from the standpoint of a critical pedagogy. I am interested in Deleuze’s concept that thinking is an exercise which demands that one create a place of unknowing in which unexpected discourses may arise. It makes sense to me that unknowing itself would be the basis for thinking because I believe that the sentiments of an individual are often the furnishings of a wider ideology. These sentiments themselves do not necessarily constitute thinking. I think that one must become self conscious of this ideology in order to make contact with the realm of thought.. Reading and writing are by big parts of my practice as an artist, but I know that there are different ways to know things which transcends these modes. I feel that art should be more integrated into daily life, including our personal behaviours and daily relationships.This workshop provides an opportunity for participants to reconfigure knowledge into more foundational areas of our lives including our relationships to ourselves and to one another. 
",,"
In the past I have used the technique of casting to create a form of sculpture which combines  figurative sculpture, with burning wax and digital projection. I know that this seems difficult to envision so please consult the following link. 

http://vimeo.com/46888685

To create this sculpture I poured wax into a cast which was taken from my head. I then inserted a wick into the hot wax, giving my head a certain mortality as the burning wick of the candle melts away the wax. I then projected a video of myself onto the candle creating an overlapping of representations.  This is a lengthy and expensive process. If I had unlimited funding I would hire studio assistants, buy lots of wax, casting materials and additional video projectors.

At the School of Making Thinking I would use these materials and labour to make casts from other participants who volunteer themselves. I would cast from different parts of the body on each participant and combine the casts into a singular body, creating a collage of many bodies together. The inspirations for this body would be taken from the somatic techniques of Roberto Freire which seek use group movement in therapy. I would broadcast projections onto this wax sculpture of participants who volunteered to have their reflections on the the somatic therapy filmed. This sculpture would be a body which transcends the individual and embodies knowledge in its collaborative form. ","
What do you draw your inspiration from?

As a writer and filmmaker my narrative are inspired listening and paying attention to dialogue around me. I am always gathering research from people in my midst and carefully observing. I have been known to tape record my family suppers to glean narratives from convoluted stories and manias.

I am currently writing a book about my narrative theories, called "" The Neurotic's Journey"", which posits, among many other ideas, that late 20th century and early 21st century cinema differs from earlier filmic forms in that it offers both a more fragmented and conflicted inner landscape in a radically intimate character subjectivity,  and a more collective and transcendent outer landscape in mythical and mystical catharsis, which transcends human identity, space, and time.  In this way for me today’s cinema is at once going in deeper and pushing out farther, at play with Deluze’s notion of cinema as crystal, Tarkovsky’s concepts of time and transcendence, Jodorwsky's Psychomagic, Jung’s collective unconscious, the notions of capitalism and patriarchy as inherently alienating,  Kristeva's  abject/eruptive female and Ponty’s exploration of the body as  experience. In addition to the book, I am working on my screenplay, Hearbeat, a psychological thriller about a girl who gets a heart transplant from her dad's lover. 
I also do psychic journeying and energy work.  I am starting an informal energy work collective with my like-minded friends. I did not  study this or seek this out, it came to me in series of  experiences that opened me into a very healing field of unknowing.  Everything I do has come from a 'not knowing'.
","I co- produced and co-directed my first film, and I co–wrote the feature screenplay for “Gabi on the Roof in July” with Larry Levine.  I am in both a writing and directing group and these have been great experiences.  Right now, I’d say biggest collaborative project  is my 8+ years of teaching. I have developed my book in collaboration with my students, who are from all over the world, with all kinds of backgrounds.  At their best it feels like our classes wire into a spaceship and the group takes off, enjoying an exponential growth in insight that is profoundly healing and productive.  I have also collaborated with my students to become a new person. They don’t need to know it – I only tell them if its useful for their development – but they have taught me a self respect and self esteem I never had before   My screenwriting work is collaborative in that I do drafts with input from friends, actors, and producers, and in directing I collaborate with actors, crews and  the realties of  the day to make shoots work. In a larger sense, I think all of us – and the earth – exist in collaboration with each other, and divisions between us are arbitrary and meaningless. In practice, I need time alone, especially since the time I spend with people touches such a deep place in me. So, like many artists I would say I swing between opening and closing – humans and solitude. I’ve been doing a lot of writing and it’s lonely. Its also lonely to do as much teaching as I do since the opening and closing is both intense and needfully boundaried. I would be excited to deal with  this opening and closing in the context of the  SMT community, and see where it could go in new and creative directions. ","http://www.hulu.com/watch/389262

I'd say the most representative is yet to come!"," I  have lived at  the Sivananda yoga ashram, which was lovely. Feature  film shoots always turns into hilarious  cult like experiences  because of stress, enforced intimacy, and  long work hours, but once I worked on a movie about a cult  where the crew  lived  in upstate NY in a house next door to set and it became a super cult - in a good way. Everyone bonded  and two  couples met who got married  ! I am respectful, calm, realistic,  non dramatic, tidy and  cool with 5 minute showers.","Given my experiences writing  fictional characters, working with students, and doing energy work with people with somatic, symptomatic, and ‘ neurotic’ states, I am excited to explore sites of tension and freedom in the body and our discourse in the first portion of the workshop. When I read texts, I often feel that I am more experiential or associative in my response,  and I would be excited to explore that work in a field  where that is foregrounded.  This would inform the work in my book about the building blocks of reality that create patterning for neurotic heroes Part of what I am working  on with the book is the leaving behind  the known into the unknown in the sense of  it being a mix of things that have not been synthesized before in a screenwriting book- personal experience, psychology, philosophy,  film theory, direct experience. I am liberated by the feminist notion  of writing from the body - that the personal is political, which  reminds me of Ponty’s radical embrace of the physical as the spiritual. I think this will lead to  a more profound  investigation of constructing being and not being, both in my book and my films. Being so in love with Deluze’s idea of the rhizome, and cinema space and time  which has informed my approach to my book, I am excited to continue  work with Ben to  investigating embodiment in the Ponty and Zen traditions.

I can't help but think quite a bit about the different ways we have and hold thoughts and information and I'm endlessly fascinated with how we convey what's inside to the outside.  The most interesting kind of people to me in my early life were those who wore their stories on weather-worn faces or showed their stripes through their sartorial selections or whose gravelled voices echoed the sounds or the roads they'd tread.  I wanted nothing more than to spend time up near people that had been marinating in experience daily until I encountered art theory at university - a whole kind of metaphysical idea world opened up that gave language, crazy, opaque, neologistic art language to the communicative elements of experience.  Ideas across time and space and culture and all that.  Then science was thrown into the mix.  I wanted to do something practical with my working time and my most cultivated practise was conversation, so, naturally, I became a mental health nurse.  In job interviews, when a medical or nursing professional asks me why I made the move from art history to nursing, I always give the same response:  Both are fundamentally about communication.  They love that, and it's true.  I've been working as a nurse for three years with a little break to move to London, UK and work at Wellcome Collection, a sensational health/medicine/art museum and to start a thematic talk radio show on NTSlive.co.uk and to write reviews of art shows and art works and to steep in culture and the wacky anomaly of London as a place. 
At the moment, I continue to make radio - show themes of late include Crying, Laughing, Restlessness, and Idle No More - I am also working with a visual artist on a sculpture/installation exploring the concept of the self, and I am writing a zine about loss with a creative witchy woman.  I daylight/nightlight as a nurse with an outpatient day program and in inpatient psychiatry at two inner-city Toronto hospitals. ","Though communicating with yourself is vital and important and interesting, the complications that arise in communicating to another person is what really gets me excited.  I'd wager all my ideas are sparked from human interaction.  One reliable feature about a person is they are not like another.  It's nuts!
In the clinical work I do (which is an integral part of my practise), I collaborate closely with my patients to convey or reinforce their self-reported symptoms and needs and I collaborate with a team of 60 or so nurses, psychiatrists, specialists, social workers, occupational therapists and support staff to make plans for medications, therapies, housing, welfare, community supports like case-managers or addictions services, truly all manner of Real Stuff.  It is very complicated work made almost fun by a shared attitude of 'help each other!' and acting upon thought instead of thinking upon thought.  It's an activating kind of collaboration and the sort of work that inspires time away from work to think about all the action.
In creative work, I started Lipstick Studios (so named for our brand of courage, lipstick), a weekly radio talk show, with co-host Angela Shackel.  We collaborated to produce every episode until I moved from London to Toronto in October 2013.  This was my first creative collaboration and it was ripe with all kinds of material for thinking on communication.  We continue to support one another by sharing notes on shows.  The experience of collaboration teaches me a great deal about my own work and has changed the way I hear or see the work of others.  This collaboration has led to others - the sculpture/installation and the zine. 
Relationships (with the self, those in networks of support, civic and community, all kinds, every kind!) and politics are fundamentally what I think about.  In that sense, you are all my collaborators, ever single breathing specimen.","Crying,' an episode I produced, wrote and recorded for Lipstick Studios is the best representation of me as a maker/thinker fit for SMT.  In this half-hour episode, crying is explored in a particular contexts, tears in a professor's office from the perspective of the crier and the witness, the method actor in tears, and as a stranger in a new city.  Hypotheses of why we cry from evolutionary psychology, social history and contemporary theory of affect and emotion were explained as well as the phsyiology of the act.  The topic reached to the heart of what I have been thinking about:  the translation of emotional knowledge and information, aspects of the interior world, to the exterior.  Emotion surfaces with tears, the effectiveness of tears as a form of communication is mitigated by the culture and circumstance of the moment in which they are witnessed.
This project reflects the way I think.  I aim to immerse my questions in my interests, the lived experience of others; art and process; biological and social sciences; and critical investigations of phenomena in theory. 
The immersive approach of SMT is tremendously appealing and would be mutually suited to my thinking / making / making thinking.  ","Victoria, BC, 2006.  Five people plus, three jobs, Vancouver Island's snowiest winter, and no heating system.  This was the most memorable of all my communal living experiences, which would be all my living experiences, because I've never lived alone for any significant stretch of time.  We used the electric oven as our hearth and read in a semi-circle with our feet propped on the open door.  We made vegetable stock from skins and peelings and seedlings were watered with a spice shaker.  I caught on fire one morning while porridge boiled and I extended my arms over the element to regain sensation.  My housemate Dennis noticed before I did and snuffed my sweater out with a dishtowel.  We made bread and subletted a room to an American Jazz singer in her fifties.    ","Would you proof read and exercise this application further?

The vision: 
Invasive Speakers - A re-interrogation of colonial take-over. 
This project would explore the transplantation of urbanised/European culture to the organised wilderness of Turtle Island through aural interrogations.  This would be a two site sound installation.  Site 1: SMT Catskills.  Speakers would be located through the site, transmitting the soundscape of a re-created British city circa the present.  Participants of the SMT residency will collectively replicate a contemporary British urban centre through voice, improvised sound effects and computer assisted city sounds.  These recordings will be looped and broadcast through the speakers as a colonial soundscape grab.
Site 2:  SMT Brooklyn.  Field recordings of the forest surrounding the Yellow house will be made during the Residency.  These recordings will be broadcast as wild noise pollution in Brooklyn.  A reminiscence, an inversion of the historical narrative of take-over, and an anxious prediction of what could be if the urban economies do not support the concrete to hold the wilds at bay.

I'm currently a doctoral candidate in the Ryerson-York Joint Program in Communication and Culture and holds an MA in Philosophy from Concordia University. In my work I gather together movement, philosophy and a critical engagement with performance. My doctoral research, seeks to engage phenomenology as practice: as a mode of embodied engagement and research that enables me to describe and articulate the process of learning movement. dance creation can open the body up to noticing new possibilities for movement and sensory engagement. Likewise phenomenology, as a branch of philosophy concerned with describing the structures of human experience and perceptual life, demands that we suspend the expectations and sedimentations of our ordinary ways of engaging with the world in order to see things as they really are.

It is frustrating to me that academics who write about performance often lack any developed sensitivities to that medium; it is equally tiring that artists who work in performance-based arenas often lack the necessary intellectual rigour to be viewed as innovators within the realm of academic knowledge production. 

I do palliative care support work one day a week at a hospital in Toronto. Last week I took my four year old friend, Nella to a dance show and it was the best day I've had so far in 2014. I make things that are true and difficult. Or at least, that's what my mom says.","In my current work, I ask questions about movement, authenticity, memory and habit. I am specifically interested descriptive analysis, based on the work of think in how the work of thinkers such as French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty, can provide insight into the experience of movement habits, space and time, as shaped by our everyday encounters with the world. Further, I am curious as to how the experience of learning dance can shed insight into the ways that we acquire embodied habits through our experiences with other people, which are then reflected or taken up in the ways we move. It is easy to think here of an example such as posture or way of walking as it might relate to experiences and feelings someone has about themselves. My research operates on a “practice as research” model, which consists of a studio practice of learning historical work by artists such as Deborah Hay, Trisha Brown and Yvonne Rainer. In learning these pieces, it is my goal to think carefully about how this era of postmodern dance is understood, historically situated, as undoing past sedimentations and ways of working. Many scholars have studied this era in dance history, yet only a few (including Toronto-based artist Megan Andrews), have chosen to approach it from the angle of actually dancing. The central question of this research revolves around how movement learning reveals our articulations of the world and how these articulations reveal important relationships between our bodies and the world, between our own body and the perception of the bodies of other people.  

I seek to create a third person window into perceptual experience. In my work I aim to set up heightened conditions for seeing, sensing and recording the experiences of other people. I am interested in notions of authenticity in movement, documentation as a performative practice, witnessing, and questions surrounding the possibilities for intimacy in digitally mediated performance spaces. I have a dynamic engagement with philosophical method: I see this as one modality of articulation for choreographic thought, and an atunement of my dance practice. The intersection of my academic and artistic work is a space of jointure, where the articulating joint is dance itself that in turns lends mobility to working in scholarly and studio based forms. I often inhabit each of these fields separately from one another, but conceive of my practice as being distributed between, and informed by, both the academic and artistic realms. 
","This is a program note I wrote for my friend, Amelia Ehrhardt's piece, ""Traditional Dance"". I'm just going to copy paste it. It isn't published anywhere yet, just went in the program. 

""Traditional Program Note or borrowed ideas from Bernard Stiegler and Jean-François Lyotard, with vague undertones of all of phenomenology and French post-structuralism, no acknowledgement of North American thinkers""

techne = to bring the immaterial into determinate presence or experience through expression in some kind of language, both art and artifice
 
Amelia is a technician, though like most of my favourite dance artists, I’ve rarely seen her throw her legs really high on stage. I only know about her technical prowess because we go to ballet class together on Monday nights. With the word ‘technician’ I don’t just mean her skill at executing ballet vocabulary. The quality of being technical, here, also refers to a particular way of spatializing meaning. Technology is objectification in the sense that it makes meaning tangible in the form of language, spoken or choreographic. To say that someone is a technician is to say that they use technology. In other words, a moving body – i.e., Amelia – uses a particular expression built through materializing ideas in the language of movement (technology) to make an inscription in time and memory.
 
By entering into the realm of language, we enter the domain of shared meaning. Deposits into this arena of shared meaning are freely available to be taken up by or ‘decoded’ because the use of technology has both semantic and material dimensions. In fact, the semantic is often the domain of communication and intelligibility. Dance training, because it is just like every other kind of language learning, moves back and forth between the material and the semantic. There is an important conversation to be had about the acquisition of information through movement training, wherein we sediment the sense data of experiential movement by inscribing it in our bodies. There is value to thinking carefully about the materiality and specificity of dance vocabulary. Another way to think about it: language reveals what there is left unsaid.
","When I was 22 I lived in a communal house. It didn't work so well. Everyone ate everyone else's food and nobody did any cleaning. There were cockroaches and everyone was mad all the time. 

Since then, I've lived in a number of communal households but never with more than 2-3 people (not counting sleepover significant others who were like 4th roommates that never paid rent). Currently I live by myself with my 15lbs cat. She's not fat, just gigantic. Here are some things I know about communal living:
- Always speak up about something that bothers you (no matter how big or small) as soon as you can and definitely before it festers and you get angry.
- Decide if you think something is essential or if you can compromise.
- Not everything will be as you like it, but some things will be magically 100x better than you imagined if you let someone surprise you with their way of doing things. 
- Don't write notes, talk to people. 
- Always ask before borrowing things, even if you think you know the person will be ok with it. 
- Listen when people tell you that you screwed up. Try to do better but know that it's ok if you also sort of screw up at that. 
- Be gentle with other people; be gentle with yourself. 
- Maintain your own boundaries and try to be sensitive to other people's.  ","I'm kind of resistant to the application of Deleuzian concepts, philosophy, etc. when it comes to practice because it seems like in the dance world at least, this largely amounts to abandoning choreographic structure and language in favour of what is viewed as ""superior"" art making. Largely this kind of work is shit and a lousy excuse for people to do whatever the hell they feel like doing because somebody did a really bad job paraphrasing what it means to think about a body without organs. 

I really think it is possible to be practically inspired by thinking along with Deleuze in a way that extends the notion of boundaries beyond the limit of phenomenology. Or maybe a better way to put that is that phenomenology, by being so explicitly a descriptive tool, becomes sometimes prescriptive when it functions as a frame for artistic practice. I'd like to explore the notion of boundaries within a broader philosophical context. ",,"Actually I don't think I need very much money for this. 

I would like try to understand better what it means to describe the experience of movement. To do this, I would (because I am a broken record) used phenomenological method. I've been thinking a lot about how to make phenomenology interesting to people who maybe don't think doing it is inherently interesting. The thing is, it's all about wonder. How do we look at the world without our preconceived notions and expectations? A lot of this course would consist of somatic work built from a cross section of techniques that I have studies including Skinner Release Technique (http://www.skinnerreleasing.com/) and Feldenkrais (http://www.feldenkrais.com/). I work a lot with improvisation. Also I would like to find a way of doing a descriptive and experiential study of empathy that doesn't include the words ""mirror neurons"".","Q: Why do people always ask you what you would do if you had a ""do over""? You know, like how people are always so curious about your big life regrets...

I think people ask this question because they are thinking and remembering their own regrets. I read an article recently about how the famous line from that Robert Frost poem, ""two roads diverged in a wood..."" is widely misinterpreted. There's this widespread obsession with trying to tell a person's character based on choices they have made in the past, as if to draw a linear correlation between who a person appears to be now and who they have been.

For the afternoon, we hiked a hillside, rolled up our pant legs and crossed a stream and found a special spot among yellow aspen leaves.  The kids and I shared some spontaneous, creative play in the landscape.  We wrapped bleached deer bones with yarn, artfully placed rosehips in the bark of a tree and created fairy house structures in the underbrush.  The kids when on to spontaneously play their string instruments and I made a few more pieces outside with yarn tied to aspen trees.

https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B9JMVWWtLRRgU0xmZ1FwbjNQYVE&usp=sharing",Session A (BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE // RECONSTRUCTING WILDNESS),"
My central project is empathy. By which I mean, the process of gently leaving to one side our own judgements and emotions, and giving our full attention to the felt reality of another human being. 


How do I work with empathy? First, I practice it. Through training in the techniques of ‘Nonviolent Communication’ (an empathy-centred approach to conflict resolution taught world-wide by hundreds of trainers), I learn (slowly!) how to bring empathy into my personal relationships. And I have begun to share these techniques with others by running weekly workshops in Oxford. Participants typically feedback that they find empathy to be a radically different, and hugely enriching, way of being with other people.


Second, I think about it. I am writing a PhD at the University of Oxford  on the centrality of empathy to morality. My affiliation is to the philosophy department, but my work draws on fields ranging from neuroscience to literary theory. My hunch is that *Western* approaches to Ethics have neglected empathy, failing to see its centrality in the way of understanding others that is foundational to having moral concern for them.


What else? 


I’ve spent a total of forty days at silent meditation retreats. I yoga, often. Last summer, I walked 800 kilometres across Spain in a pilgrimage that led me to confront  overwhelming angers and griefs I didn’t know I carried. 

I have 1000+ hours experience leading outdoor education with children. And I have a particular interest in treasure hunts (more on this below). I think a lot about how to utilise innovative pedagogical approaches to create deep learning experiences in the classroom. A course I ran last summer on ‘philosophy of good life’ took students beyond the classical texts to visit a Buddhist temple and an organic farm, and to conduct happiness creation experiments on the streets of Oxford. 
","
A central theme in my work with empathy is creating encounters between people that facilitate independent working. 


One of the gifts of offering empathy to another person, is that you create a space for them to empathise with themselves. That is, when you attentively and lovingly acknowledge their felt reality - their emotions, longings, memories, pains - you give them space and confidence to do it for themselves. And that can be tremendously healing. The healing work is done by themselves, but facilitated and enabled by the collaborative space. I try to create these spaces in my workshops.

In my formal academic work, I enjoy creating a similar kinds of spaces. Typically, this takes the form of exchanging presentations on latest thinking with fellow graduate students. Even if the other person does not say anything, even if I am ‘doing all of the work’, I find their presence tremendously helpful. It imposes a clarity and rigour on my thought. More than that, it makes me honest.  In asking another person to attend to my work, I must ask myself ‘is this really worth paying attention to? Do I really care about it?’. If the answer is anything other than an emphatic yes, I look to reconnect with my work and / or redirect it. 

This demand for authentic passion is even stronger when I teach. When young people entrust me with their time, I feel moved to provide them with learning that will inspire and empower them (as opposed to boring them or disillusioning them). Thus I must ask: does this material - this theory - really inspire and empower me? 

Academic collaboration is also an invaluable source of feedback and advice for future learning.

How do you turn Shakespeare into a treasure hunt suitable for business executives?

Much of my most creative work has occurred in the outdoor education context. To begin with, this involved working as an instructor at a summer camp for children. It then evolved into the notion of running day-long treasure hunts for adults, utilising cars, codes, spying, and buried treasure. Themes ranged from ‘the quest for the Holy Grail’, to ‘Surviving the Credit Crunch’. In summer 2012, this enthusiasm led me on to a month-long commissioned project for a Shakespeare education charity, who asked: how can we find a new way of engaging corporate supporters with our work?

My answer was to come up with a Shakespearean themed murder mystery treasure hunt, utilising a cast of 6 actors, and 3 historic locations in the city of London. After a chilling investigation of a murder scene (think: dark room, only lit by the candles atop the rose-strewn altar; on that altar lies a cold body, clutching a photo and a dictaphone) participants spent two hours solving clues and interviewing suspects and witnesses, before coming to a verdict. The plot contained elements from Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, and numerous history plays. The challenge was in working out which plot would lead you to the killer (was it romantic suicide? The jealous brother? Or the power-hungry rivals?).

The event was run with their office staff and trustees (see photos in the link below), and received excellent feedback (one trustee - a former deputy governer of the Bank of England - told me enthusiastically that I could make a lot of money offering this to American tourists. Then again, maybe it was just because he won.)

I also once made a birthday treasure hunt for a friend that featured glow-in-the dark murals of Platonic dialogues, and a message in a bottle being discovered in Sri Lanka.

One of my central aspirations for the coming years is to find a way of bringing this creative energy into my academic work on empathy (see below for more thoughts on this).

Link for photos and clues from Shakespeare event (as above):

In summer 2011, I spent eight weeks as a member of an eleven person team that travelled through the Balkans (Croatia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Serbia) delivering sport and play activities to disadvantaged children. We worked together, lived together, travelled together (in a minibus). The work was exhausting. Divisions arose from love and unrequited love. Frustrations arose around the way that the trip was managed. But we survived. Even when we collided with a herd of sheep on a Bosnian road.

Learnings I took from that experience include: people appreciate having time and space to be alone. It is vital to create a space where people feel able to honestly express tensions and difficulties in a non-threatening way. 

","
I think that the opportunity to collaborate with other passionate thinkers and artists will radically energise and inspire me in ways that I cannot predict. Is that enough?

In particular - I am interested in the theme of wildness. I’m interested in applying to the notion of empathy - that is, to consider the notion of wild empathy. 

Wildness captures the sense that in connecting with ourselves, we radically cast of social norms around presenting ourselves. We strip off inherited ways of thinking, to just honestly be. This reality that lies beneath is, in this sense, wild. Empathising with ourselves is to connect with our wildness. Empathy with others is to connect with their wildness.

But what is down there? What pains and angers do we find? What desires and longings? Is our basic nature really a compassionate one as Buddhists might proclaim?

And how to we feel when we encounter this wildness in ourselves and others? Terrified? Awe-inspired? Affirmed? Endeared?

I am also interested in wildness in a second sense - in the role of wilderness as a facilitating venue for this process of connecting with our humanity; in how being in wild spaces opens us up and transforms our consciousness. 

More generally, I am excited to find new creative methods to bridge the gap between philosophy and this practice that we call living. 

",,"
DISCOVERING THE WILDERNESS (WITHIN)

First, I would seek to utilise the natural setting to work on processes of self-empathy: exploring the day to day reality of how I felt to be at the residency, and linking this felt reality to deeper parts of myself: enthusiasms and passions, but also trenchant anxieties and fears, and mournings for lost friends & family members.

Second, I would seek to create encounters with other participants to start unlocking their  experience of the residency, and how those experiences related to their stories, their realities. 

Third: From this work, with myself and others, I would seek to piece together  ‘empathic media’ that spoke to the collective experience of the residency, and to the deeper stories of the participants: salient photos, drawings, audio snippets, textual explorations. 

And finally, using these media, I would then develop an immersive ‘treasure hunt experience’ to offer other participants at the end of the residency. For a few hours, participants would explore the local wilderness, following clues based around the ‘empathic media’. A gurgling stream might provide the venue for some reflections on the passing (the transitoriness) of the residency. Under the shade of a giant tree, we might find images capturing salient moments of childhood. 

This, then, would be an exploration of wilderness of three levels. First, there is the exploring of the wild truth of others. Second, there is the physical exploration of the wild setting. Through these two aspects, participants would be stimulated to experience their own wildness.

in high school i’d escape to san francisco and the woods and beaches of marin. i searched for wildness in thrift stores, and magazines. there was no way to google it then. i moved to santa barbara and lived amongst the lemon-scented eucalyptus and the stale beer drenched fraternities. different types of wildness. each year i sat with the great monarch migration in a nearby coastal grove. i read recently their population is dwindling. 
i avoided los angeles for years. all i knew were the frightful things one could see from a car window on the 5 fwy during rush hour traffic. eventually it called me and i answered. i live here now, in a neighborhood with staircases that cut through people's yards, leading up or down to the next crooked street. there are still pockets of wildness in los angeles. I find it growing out of cracks in freeway overpasses, and the cemented LA river.
my work is designing costumes for film. i spend many days in warehouses climbing ladders to reach clothing hung three levels high. i love the vintage show girl and clown hat section at Warner Brothers Costume. It’s located at the very top of aisle 15 white. it's a rag tag bunch, all crooked sequins and bent feathers. there's a lot of character amongst the lopsided bows. I imagine they have their own wild stories to tell.
","my work is collaborative from start to finish. primarily film is created to be viewed by an audience. they interact with the medium and the story being told. but before that, it is imagined and shared by the writer, director and creative team. as a costume designer i imagine the way the world looks. each project is different. the director must also agree with my vision. with the help of other costumers, tailors and craftspeople we curate and create a selection of clothes that represent each character in the story. my favorite element of this process is when actors arrive for their fittings. we sift through the possibilities i've gathered until they find objects that aid them in becoming their character. it usually starts with a single item. the right pants, jacket or hat. and then it builds into an entire look. a real imagined person. these elements combine with hair, and make-up and finally walk onto the set a production designer has created.  ideally at this moment an imagined world becomes unified and complete. the camera records the results. because there are so many ingredients, it takes a lot to create a great film. it's like alchemy. everything must combine in just the right way to become magic.","http://emilybatson.com/the-pretty-one

last spring i designed the costumes for a film called The Pretty One. the story follows twin sisters. one beautiful, colorful and living an adventurous life in the city. the other shy, still living at home and wearing the faded old clothes from her dead mother's closet. through a terrible accident, a case of mistaken identity unfolds and the shy twin finds herself mirroring her sister's life, only to discover a new more authentic life for herself. 

one actress played both sisters and it was fun to create two very different characters who begin to bleed into one another as the story unravels. it's a story of self exploration and acceptance. about stretching beyond the places we find comfortable. while i worked on the film, i was simultaneously reading a book written by Marianne Woodman a Jungian psychologist. the books used fairytales to explain the process of balancing the feminine and masculine aspects of our psyche. 
the films seemed to use the same type of allegory. 
and likewise, it seems to somehow fit with the theme of wildness.","after graduating from college, i went on the obligatory backpacking trip to europe. the first friend in my group split off to become engaged to her boyfriend in florence ( they never got married) the other fell in love with a man who owned a bungee jump on the greek island we were visiting. i found myself on a cog rail train climbing up the swiss alps to a chalet hostel. i lived there for 3 weeks and acted as the housekeeper in exchange for room and board. the owner was fastidious. there were notes stuck to every cupboard and above the sink explaining how to wash / use everything correctly. in the mornings i would do my chores. i learned that cleaning things that were already clean was far easier than  cleaning things that were dirty. after work i would go for a hike with the other employees, or ride a bike down the mountain, or visit the hot springs or just sit and watch the fog roll in to the valley below. we would make communal meals in the evening, and slept in bunk beds at night. ",i was raised in a very structured environment. there were lots of obligatory rituals. the nature of my work is quite goal and deadline oriented. clothes must fit a specific body. alterations need to be completed at a specific time. the shirt must be blue. i would really just love to be in a place that offered a different approach to living and creating. it's an experience i think i would find both challenging and liberating. exploring how to allow myself to be. to create something from what arises. it is often an impulse that get's buried in the process of daily life.  this sounds like a great opportunity to relax and explore what unfolds. ,,one idea is to make a quilt. something tactile. a square for each day or each new discovery. maybe each square is a written story or a painting. maybe the story is in the color and the texture of the fabric. maybe it is pieced together from fabric  contributed by and holding stories from each participant in the program.  i only just learned about this residency so i haven't had too much time to formulate my ideas. i'm not quite ready to commit to the exact process. but i do always like to work with fabric. and i'm interested in how that interacts with stories and experience.,"question: is it too late to apply to this residency?

answer: i certainly hope not.


",i'm committed to making time this year for a project or adventure that exists outside my chosen career field and my familiar landscape. these dates and this program seems like an ideal scenario. my schedule is varied but flexible :),my friend drew denny,i eat mostly anything.

I came here to work on two plays with a group of Lebanese and Ethiopian theater artists. With the help of a grant I’ll be here two months. I arrived yesterday. It smells like cumin and gasoline. It’s beautiful and noisy. 

I mostly write plays, which means I live in a world of making things with other people. It also means I run away to my room to write. I have a big crush on novels, and essays, I think because I love how intimate reading is – language structures pass into one’s brain and talk with thoughts and memories. I’d like my plays to do that too.

I studied humanities at Yale, and then moved to Savannah with friends to start an arts nonprofit. The nonprofit lives on – after-school creative writing classes for middle schoolers – but I peeled off to come to New York because I missed the hurly-burly of a bigger city. I joined a writers’ group called Youngblood, and helped start a theater company called American Centaur. I’ve found collaborators who are kindred spirits. Lately I’ve been working on projects other people initiated: an adaptation of a Yiddish novel, an adaptation of Love’s Labours Lost, a musical about Earth First!, and now an adaptation with music of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. (I guess it seems like a lot of adaptations, but “adaptation” is a veeeery loose term.) These are all in various stages of happening/just-happened/will-happen-one-day. It’s nice to have people with a certain amount of infrastructure approach me about joining them as a writer. It can be a challenge to take on material I didn’t select. I’ve learned a lot. I love it. 

I write essays, too. But super slowly. 
","For a while I thought I might have been a maker of devised theater, who enters a rehearsal room with a set of questions and prompts, guides a flock of actors, and stitches together the resulting material into a “collaborative” piece. Now I think I am mostly a playwright, which is to say, someone who writes a play and brings it to rehearsal. I like following a thought very far down a road. Also I’m not good at talking about how a thing should be, I’m better at just making the thing itself, based on inarticulate thoughts and sensations – I stew for weeks and then write something askew, just so, aslant from reality in some satisfyingly itchy way. Once the thing is there, on a page, it is a joy to talk about it with collaborators, to test its joints and see what squeaks, to be challenged in the spots where I pulled up short to dive deeper. 

I recently made a piece in which I wrote a script for a particular group of actors, some of whom I knew well and others of whom I didn’t. They all played characters who had their actual names. One told me that it was uncanny, how close to home some of the lines I’d written for him hit. (I’m interested in understanding that more: why?) Increasingly, I’m interested in this process of writing for specific performers because real people are strange and lovely and tug my writing in unexpected directions.

A good playwright knows how to strike each element of live theater – objects, actors, space, audience – and let it ring out loud clear and beautiful in its own key. That’s good collaboration, I think.
","This is not a project I initiated or wrote but that’s partly my point. 

Two summers ago, I played one of the students in a bootleg punk-anarchist Les Mis that I heard about and showed up for. There were fifty-two of us. We lived in a field and rehearsed under a circus tent. I had a few solo lines but mostly I sang in the chorus and carried around a paper-mache gun and looked adoringly at the actor playing Enjolras. I learned to use a sewing machine, I learned how to sing high without hurting my voice, I learned how to dumpster dive, I got terribly sick, I washed naked in the woods, I made dear friends, and I sprained an ankle. All fifty-two of us were putting in sixteen-hour days. I’d come because I wanted to. I liked just about everyone. Still, I found myself retreating into an I sometimes, and the big thing I learned was how not run away from a We. I’s are important and it’s easy to hold fast to an I because your I is what you know. We is no one’s I, We is uncertain, I can’t control We. When We finally performed Les Mis – six times, in four cities – We were performing a schmaltzy Broadway hit but we were also performing the We we’d made in that month in that field. The whole endeavor was ridiculous, and We were performing the strangeness of We’s loyalty to it. 

That gets at something essential to me: Set up something ridiculous, and have the perverse patience to be loyal to it. Step out of what you know, and have the courage to stand on ridiculous ground. When you do that, people gather, however ridiculously, and when people gather and work hard and are silly together… that’s sacred. 
","That summer in Vermont was one. Fifty people lived in tents and ate together and worked together and took turns emptying the bucket we all pooped in. I worked hard, and occasionally took time to myself – that was how I existed in that space. 

Until recently, I lived in a nine-person warehouse space in Brooklyn. There was no unifying project – people generally kept to themselves – but we shared cleaning duties, and had to make a couple of thorny decisions as a group. Those decisions were tricky, and one in particular caused some damage – mostly to one house member in particular, but to everyone else, too, I’d argue. My read on it is this: There were longstanding rules and policies about house membership. Rules are important. But. It’s dangerous to avoid open conversation about conflict in favor of impartial rule-enforcement. Rules are rules, but people are people, and the chance to hear and be heard are what allow us to live together well.

I love cooking with people. I love standing in a kitchen together, with people coming and going. I love cleaning up together. I love huge stacks of mismatched plates.  
","Last year I fell in love with a few anarchist thinkers, and this year I fell in love with a few Jewish thinkers. I love the anarchists because they love the mess of uncertainty, and because they remind me to walk and encounter people and worlds without the handrails of the familiar. I love the Jewish thinkers because they love the creative power of structure. They have a radical commitment to constructing spaces – however narrow-seeming – of the sacred in this world. 

The session on wildness seems like a space where anarchists and Jews might meet.

I’m interested in how that space might inform my creative practice. I’d relish the chance to leave the physical architecture of New York City, and the familiar mental architecture of the writer’s space or rehearsal room. 

My instinct is that Jewish law exists in conversation with the world’s wildness. My instinct is that clarifying the ground on which one stands – which is what Jewish law is doing – allows one to relate to wildness without demand, or possessiveness. 

Because as much as I love anarchist thought, I worry that an infatuation with a certain aesthetic of anarchy (as opposed to an anarchist way of thinking) risks exploiting the people and the world around us. 

My plays are always part prayer; they are a form of research into freedom. I am always trying to catch something alive, delicate, green-smelling, wild in my plays, however carefully constructed and rigorously rehearsed. 
","I'm interested in forgetting as a creative practice. 

I'm still working out what that means.

I'm interested in how forgetting -- or at least attending to the spaces around the things we can't remember -- creates space for self-reinvention. I've always felt like I'll never be the old Henry James ""writer is someone on whom nothing is lost"" thing because I have such a bad memory for things.

I'm interested in exploring how lapses in memory make us who we are. I'm interested in how our lapses interact with others' rememberings, or vice versa, and how lapses behave when they meet other lapses. 

I'm interested in exploring strong emotional attachments that have been emptied of any content (""I don't remember why I love this place""). Could we fabricate such attachments? 

I'm interested in the fear that attends the possibility of not knowing some key part of one's past. 

I'd like to investigate ways of reproducing such blank spaces in art, especially embodied art like theater or dance or film. ","I am interested in a play as a container, and dramatic structure – however loosely understood – as architecture. So: I would like to build a small room that was also a play. 

I would use my limited building skills – and perhaps acquire new ones – to construct the room from wood, fabric, plastic, glass… As I build the room, I’d be writing text that corresponds to different parts of the space. A song for this hole, an argument for that roof beam. I’m curious if paying attention to what makes a sturdy room could result in an unexpectedly sturdy but nonlinear play. Depending on how far I get, I might sleep in the room, eat in the room, host other people who want to come visit the room, and see how all that could inform the play. There will of course be chinks in the room for breeze or rain or grass smells and of course the hope is that those things end up in the play, too. 

Texts behind this are maybe Woolf, A Room of One’s Own, Baldwin, Giovanni’s Room, Heschel on the architecture of time, and Renee Gladman’s on architectural sentences and imaginary places. 
","Do you feel good at talking about your art? Do you think it's important to be good at talking about your art? 

I don't feel great at talking about my art. I'm getting better. I know it can be super helpful to be able to talk about one's art, but I think I also would like to make that doesn't quite bear talking about.

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B23QmQVFiGV9ck92U0EtQTFXeGc/edit",Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING),"I'm a creative spirit who caught the acting bug at age 11 when reciting The Highwayman to her fellow fifth grade classmates. I'm a musician who studied classical piano for 8 years and now is trying her luck as a singer in an alternative rock band. I'm someone who improvises. Who has a quick wit. Who likes puns and isn't afraid to throw you one the moment it occurs to her. I'm someone who understands rhythm. Who wonders if I should try freestyling for reals because any time I give it a go at a party I'm kind of ridiculously awesome at it. I'm a writer with lots of ideas (and scenes) but who has yet to write her first full length play. I am a theater and film goer and music listener with a keen eye and ear for what moves me and captures me and surprises me and what looks forced and pushed and cliche and patronizing. I'm a passionate artist who wants to create that which moves and captures and surprises and transports people. I'm someone who thinks she'd make a great director -- of film or theater -- because she understands what it is to be an actor and what it is to be an audience and because she can communicate and consider and lead and follow. I'm someone who thinks she'd make an excellent DJ because she knows what kind of music drives her to dance and she thinks it's excellent stuff. I am an actress who does really good work. Work her classmates and teachers admire. Work that landed her a full tuition scholarship to ACT, and has landed her some great jobs and gotten her some great reviews. I'm an actress who doesn't work as much as she'd like to. I'm an actress who wants to create something.","I've learned that the best kind of acting is collaborative. When actors are really playing off each other. The circle of collaborators in this case is made wider by the director and the playwright, and in performance the audience - all offering further possibilities for integration and inspiration. My goal as an actor is to do my preparation, to know where I'm coming from, and then to remain open to how these other elements will affect or guide me in the moment. When the channels are open it can feel like these elements are working both with me and through me. It feels sublime, and I daresay spiritual. There's excitement in the unknown and anchoring in the flow of what's happening. I've encountered something similar in music, which is why I'm now in a band.

Collaboration also exists at a far more messy, less polished level. And the creative work I've done with Clown, Improv, Movement based composition, and Sketch Comedy are examples of that. There is usually more chaos, more mess, and perhaps a need for more negotiation, and compromise. Navigating those waters with my co-creators can become an art itself, but things generally just find a way of taking shape and working out. It's very cool to be a part of that. There is often such willingness in the room, such allowance, and such a unique group dynamic, that the work we end up with is something we never could have found without each other or without the mess.","Senior year at Brown I took a class called Solo Performance. 12 students wrote 12 solo shows. My show was called Whitenoise; it was about my family. The divorce, the remarriages, the coming of age, the dark secrets, and perhaps more interesting the stories about my grandmother, her use of LSD, a shady character she dated, and what he might or might not have done to my aunt. It was easy enough to pour out the material. To bring it in and perform it for my peers. But the piece really came together when I decided to incorporate a performance art device I'd developed a year earlier in a class called Advanced Performance. Our professor had given us the assignment ""Overheard Conversations;"" I eavesdropped at cafes, took notes, and poured over them...how would I perform this, what was the link... I arrived at a conclusion about superficiality -- that sometimes we need the superficial just to converse -- and this led me to the idea of animating one's face with make up in order to communicate. In the practicing of it, I discovered exciting nuanced choices I could make. In the performing of it...success! The class loved it. An exchange took place. And the feedback from that class inspired me to bring it in to the next one, where I found out it could server to anchor my show. I explored the construct further the following year when I performed a shortened version of the show - or you might call it a lengthened version of the performance art - at two different spaces in San Francisco. I use this example so you can get a sense of how I might play with an idea, and how I might work with that idea and bring it to performance. Although the creation was a solo venture, without the classes, without the spaces and the people that inspired risk, accepted flops, offered feedback, and hoped for brilliance, nothing would have happened.","I am my happiest in communal living situations. I currently live in my 6th communal sitch since college. I've found most on Craigslist, including this one. I joined a 7 roommate, 3 story house in Ditmas Park just a couple summers ago. A house with a porch, laundry, the occasional Sunday night dinner, and even some biggish parties. Totally awesome stuff for yours truly. Then our lease holder's girlfriend moved in, and the couple began fighting and calling the cops on each other and throwing computer monitors down the stairs and giving each other black eyes, so I and three girls moved out. We're now in the top 2 floors of another lovely house with laundry and porches in the same hood. We have dinner parties sometimes and are looking forward to using our lovely back garden when the weather gets nice. Oh and there are no big fights or black eyes. We get along really really well.","Sometimes I'm told I think too much. It's true. I do. I can. However I have my brain to thank for some of the biggest blessings I've encountered in my life, and some of the greatest achievements. I like the idea of exploring thinking. Perhaps by not thinking. Knowing by not knowing. I believe that my heart and soul and instincts are perhaps smarter and more keenly equipped to lead my artistic endeavors than my mind, yet my mind is certainly a necessary part of the equation! I'm interested in what I might be separating from or letting go of by unthinking. How this might change my approach to projects or life in general. Or what I might integrate into my process by knowing thinking differently. It seems confusing and therefore rich ground for me to play in. It also parallels a theme I'm pondering in my life right now...letting go versus showing up. When to release. When to follow. When to think. When to know. When to not know. When to not think. Trusting. Leaping. Tuning in to flow.

As I mentioned before I'm a girl with ideas. Maybe it's the Libra Moon/Rising in me. They say airy people have lots of ideas they don't follow through on. I also have an Aries sun (opposite sign of Libra) so if there is validity to this stuff it may help to explain why I can be a bit of a frustrated artist or individual. Pulled by polarity. One who has fiery instincts to follow, but keen to consider and weigh the possible outcomes. I want a blank canvas. Space. Time. To play. To develop something. To integrate the ideas and the skills. A play. A film. A performance art piece. Webisodes. I'm truly not sure yet. But I'm capable. And I'm talented. And I look forward to discovering the piece would manifest through me at SMT.",,"There was a time I stood on the subway platform at Broadway/Lafayette, and I stared at the sign that read ""Broadway"" above this little cutout in the wall that almost looked like a door. I imagined myself sitting there with a pickaxe, slowly chiseling away like a scene in a Matthew Barney film. Eventually I'd find a door behind the concrete and I'd chisel and pull and finally end up crawling out of a hole in a big green field somewhere and I'd look down and see this tiny little rock I crawled out of. And then I'd drop kick it down the field. 

I can envision creating and directing a film at SMT that has a bridge between the real and the unreal. I imagine special effects and/or animation would help to most fully realize this, but the goal would be to make the viewer intimate with the main character's mind. How she sees, how she dreams. Perhaps her journey would be about how she uses the unreal to function in the real, and/or vice versa, or where she finally chooses to dwell and why. Something rich in images and dreamlike ideas. Perhaps the film just is fantasy and there would be nothing real about it. Other than the character's journey. A recognizably human one.","What will you want to teach your children when it comes to art? I will encourage play. Lots of play! I will sing to them at night and join in when they sing in the car. Any old nonsense. I will make sure they spend plenty of time outside. I will teach them how to build troll houses by the stream and sing songs around a campfire and I will encourage the building of forts in a variety of locations with a variety of materials. I will encourage time alone for them. To think. To draw. To nurture their imaginations. I will love what they do and encourage them to love what they do too. (For the record, I don't have kids. But I felt inclined to write this. When I think of my inner artist I think about childhood. Mine and my unborn's.)

I was at a very serious journalism festival in Italy, where I had been invited to present my work. It was already slightly disruptive of us to simply announce our name: Audio Smut, while on panels with serious journalists from the Washington Post and the New Yorker. Fortunately, the head of the audio department (who invited us) has a Finbloom-esque mischeiviousness about him. We had his 100% support.

The festival was comprised of formal seminar style talks, formal screenings, and formal panel discussions. My collaborator and I created a large installation. It had flowing purple fabric, gauzy pink tool, gold sparkles. It was a portable booth, where two people could escape the crowds and stand in privacy, enshrouded by the flowing fabric and sparkling lights. Inside, our subjects were greeted by a lady in a pink jacket. Dangling from the ceiling were 3 cards, with 3 questions. The subject would pick a question, and each would share a story pertaining to the question. All was audio recorded, for use in future documentary work. 

The reception was explosive. We had a line-up of 15-20 going all afternoon. People were asking about it the entire festival: ""Are you going to remount the magic sound booth?"". It was a sight for sore eyes. This project strikes me as SMT-esque, in that it looked at what was possible in a given setting and went wacky on what was expected. ","I live in a big house with 5 other people and I fucking love it.

One of my goals as an artist is to unravel the tight grip that my intellectual mind has on my process. I want access my unbridled spirit. 
I think that my unbridled spirit is tapped into something true and fresh in me. I think analysis should come after, or happen at a different time than creating. I would like to practice making art by trusting my instincts. I think this is the only way you can truly tap in to the collective unconscious, which is where the truths-we-know-but-are-afraid-to-say live. Another of my goals as an artist is to say the truths-we-know-but-are-afraid-to-say (or even better: the truths we aren't' sure about, and are afraid to say) 

","I would like to lead a secret luxury game. 

I think there is always a near-breaking point when on a wilderness adventure. A point where you are tired, and hungry, and damp, and cold. I would like to have everyone write down something they need to feel cared for on a piece of paper. Then distribute the papers at random. It is your job to give the person on the paper what they need, when you think they need it. ","I would collaboratively write, mix and master an album of non-fiction audio infused music.

The story features voices from intimate interviews, on a topic derived from the-truth-that-we-aren't-sure-about-and-are-afraid-to-say. There will be explicit sexual content that is true to life. 

OR

I would like to create a sound designed performance, where someone's movements are designed as in the first scene of Daisies. ","Why is going to SMT important to you?

Going to SMT is important to me because I am thoroughly and completely and obsessively engrossed in my radio work, and I want to break the fuck out and shake up my process. Think new thoughts. Answer to new rules. ","NO!

I started in TV to create a network run entirely by children.  that was 1993-ish.  I have - to an extent - done that successfully in small pieces, but the $$ has been a little challenging.  For the past ten years I have mostly made my living covering fashion (fun).  Lately I've been doing some shooting for THE DOCTORS, a daytime talk show, shooting vagina-related material.  children's tv. fashion. vaginas.  I'm on a roll... and I am loving shooting for other people instead of just for my own projects.  I want to build my well spring muscle, the thoughtful and grounded joy that gushes tactfully out of oneself - that is based on one's love for life and experiences and both makes sense and is mysteriously ethereal and not-able-to-be-planned.  I want this because I have spent alot of my life creating within others' boundaries and I'm ready to be. in. charge.  this is why I would like to be educated in and with SMT.","I love working with people, creating space for others to do their best work.  and I am ETERNALLY GRATEFUL to the few people who have done that for me.  I like to pull a team together based on what each person does well, and create from there.  that said, I can be an anxiety monster and that is probably my greatest professional and creative obstacle.  I know the way to make my projects be finished well and on time and there is not always the time to give everyone to their creative processes.  this is the greatest challenge working with children - the perfect storm of process and product.  a brilliant video editor has been MY key to driving the project into excellence.","I wrote poems and Short Short Stories in my early twenties to overcome writers block.  Most of them are in a box somewhere, but are still relevant.  The dancing of words that would be fun to tap into again in a raw way....

I am commercial, for lack of a better word, meaning I mostly always work for money since I NEED money and also don't seem to have the discipline to get anything finished without a deadline / air date. double necessity.  that said, I always bring an authentic perspective to the work and I think that's what my clients appreciate about me.

In my first apartment, my roommates and I were the first stop for our friends moving to SF from the east coast.  They stayed with us until they found an apartment, usually with other friends of ours or theirs - all blended together.  My second 'communal' apartment was great too.  We all cooked meals together, had  a 'house' grocery list that we all shared in $ and collecting (bulk and farmers market). One of my roommates was founding the Wise Fool Puppet Company so even though I was working ridiculous hours (overnight work shifts and school all day), I could still come home and help make puppets for a while, share a meal that we all cooked, and take a bath which was my then-version of eight hours of sleep.  I also had the added benefit of participating in all the Wise Fool events - parades, plays.  I could pop my stilts on and go... able to keep my own packed schedule and still participate in and support my friends amazing company.  I have also lived communally shorter term on vacations and often fantasize about living in a more collective environment...with children and families or fun adventuresome adults.  or both.","A SUMMIT ON A SUMMIT:
This session will aid my open-minded development by dropping me into the deep end of SMT, really playing with other people who are involved in the school and/or who are attracted to the school – a  nice sampling of people ready to dive in and explore together.  I look forward to being in a state of mind that is receptive to spontaneous communal creation, support, and loving challenge.

UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING
The length of time that this session is in and of itself has the possibility of opening me up to manifest creation that is out of my own unique box.  I like that it seems a little loose but still has required reading, as well as challenges for the mind/body/spirit.
","off the top of my head:
1)  everyone offers one word.  each person must make a poem out of everyone's words and then do a poetry reading
2)  each person must make one adornment out of the natural environment and this adornment is the core of their character during one whole meal with the others
3)  in a river, each participant makes a sculpture in the moving water out of stones.  one (self) selected gallery guide takes the group for a tour of each sculpture as each artist tells how his/her work is like their grandmother - or any older ancestor they choose

","I have shot a couple of interviews and would like to shoot MANY of people talking about the first time they had sex.  This is a wide open question that can get into first orgasm, first (extreme feeling) sexual experience at ANY age.... the first sex with the boyfriend/girlfriend from a great relationship in which they WAITED, tainted childhood experiences, same-sex titillation that felt wrong/great/confusing (and WHY).  if I were to start NOW, I'd need full cooperation of people at SMT to interview them (since I only have two so far) and maybe it would start out with the raw, first person, first remembrance and then I could edit that and then add group discussions of sex - explore with a wider group in a more general fashion.  so much to talk about sex... we could go on and on...

I also have shot a MILLION hours of my nieces and nephews growing up and it would be cool to really sit down and hack away at that... load it all up and organize, make a plan...","Which way does infinity go?
because of our thinking, infinity goes deep - inside and out.  infinity is the on and on of our love for someone, the anguish that comes with it, the piled on thoughts that make us feel about something and then also release the feelings to just.  be.  LOVE.  (which is all we are anyway).  because of our thinking, we can either allow ourselves to just BE, a state in which love, spirit, light flows through us... or we can COMPLICATE things INFINITESSIMALY with second guesses and layers of speculation.  this, to me, is infinity going IN...

Infinity going OUT may be more than 100 words...not so sure about counting now... it's ALL the possibility... the COUNTRIES where we have not been, the culture that we cannot grasp - from the Maharaja to sex trafficking to outer space.... where we CAN go is all still in our thinking because if we could think differently, then we could all think the same and have no wars and drink coconut milk on the beach......so THINKING is infinity because it's ever evolving and ever driving the choices we make OUTWARDLY.  and Worldy...",none.,Josephine Decker,I am up for trying just about anything.

My virtue is the questions that I can't let go of; the why, the so what, the what for, and the what does it mean.  As tiring and difficult as they are, I am committed to them.  My work deals more with the ""how"" of fear.  Fear as a given element in a social life, and how to acknowledge, allow, and circumvent fear of other people that keeps me moving and can push me to isolation. Through my work, individual or collaborative, my goal is to create situations and systems that bring people toward each other.  I draw on tactics from relational aesthetics and social practice, engineering spaces for interaction and producing relationships as the work of art.  For example, I have worked with Craigslist offering my sponsorship- or advice, presence, friendship, mentorship- to strangers on the internet.  The relationships and conversations that were born of that offer are what I consider my art.  I value making myself as vulnerable as I am asking participants in my work to become.  I consider my work a process or tool with which myself and those involved can grow.","My practice is often physically collaborative.  I work with another person to make the piece of art.  Sometimes this means building with another person, hashing out every measurement and angle aloud.  Sometimes it means that conversation is an integral part of the project, and people volunteer to talk to me.  Sometimes it is collaborative in that I ran my design/writing/idea by ten people in my community before I got to the final piece.  I always look at my work with other people and they help me to figure out what the piece is, what it does, what it means, and why it exists.  Or at least bring me closer to understanding.","https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B16HTlj0PVuUZ2ZnekhTelF3bW8/edit?usp=sharing

This project is ongoing.  I meet with people (anyone who signs up), and we talk about what isn't working in their lives, the things that are running them around, or the feeling they can't seem to describe.  This conversation usually lasts 45 minutes to an hour.

Afterwards, I sit with what I've heard, and try to distill a theme or trend.  From this I write a prescription, which is a string of words and a course of sugar pills.  I design the packaging and literature of the prescription from scratch for each ""patient"".","I've lived in communal houses when I was younger in Santa Cruz, CA.  Sometimes it was lovely, and sometimes it was oppressive.  It was lovely when we communicated effectively, and had systems of organization we all agreed upon.  With these things in place, I lived joyfully with seven other people in a house by the beach.  We met weekly for check-ins about our house and our lives.  I've lived in communal houses in which the communication was lacking, or the co-habitators had no interest in maintaining a comfortable environment for everyone in the house.  ","I am so excited about this session that I am filling out this whole application 4 days after the deadline, with no idea if it will even submit when I hit the button.  Thinking as a muscle, as an excursive regimen, as an occupation, as a sport is critical to my work, my life, and my faith.  I want help in entering a liminal thinking space I've never visited, to think what I do not know how to think.  My understanding of art is informed by phenomenology and objects and people defining themselves over and over again by their relationships.  To be worked by this session I think would allow me to approach my work with a much more delicate approach to the spaces of ambiguity in my work.",A guided meditation fraught with assumptions.,"With unlimited funding I'd build a ropes course.  50 feet above the ground in the trees.  It would take 2 or more hours to traverse the entirety.  And then I would build, with the help of everyone there, houses in the trees while we stand on the wires and platforms of the ropes course.  We would wear harnesses and carabiners, so it'd be safe and possible.  I'm not immediately certain what this has to do with the course I'd love to take, but given unlimited funding in any scenario I want to do this.","What was the most pressing question on your mind two years ago, a year ago and what is it now?

Two years ago I wanted to know HOW TO GET UP AND NOT FALL DOWN.  How to get up on time, check all the things off the list, be nice to fellows, eat, and all these exhausting things (or rather things that were exhausting then) without lapsing into NOT GETTING UP.

A year ago I wanted to know HOW TO BE GOOD, how to satisfy moral criteria of everyone at once.  How to never be bad.  

Now I want to know HOW TO MAINTAIN EMPATHY THROUGH CHAOS.  I am busy every moment, and I have failed to schedule time to be available to people around me.  Do I need to schedule empathy in a weekly planner?  ",,A professor,None

I came across the program in December, but hadn't checked back for a deadline. I thought I should try for a spot anyway. 

I am a passionate, curious artist, who likes to occupy and agitate the background. I graduate from York University in 2012 with a BFA in Visual Art and Psychology. I'm currently working on my MA in Art History at York University. I work in performance, sound, video and multiples to explore magic and queerness. I volunteer at an LGBTQ youth service in the city and regularly attend community education sessions. I try to find creative and nurturing ways to build my community, without falling adhering to dogmas and (sometimes limiting) tropes. I try to be aware of my energy, the space I find myself in and those around me (or not). ","I would describe my creative/intellectual practice as mischievous. I like to slip around things and circle them. I think that humour is an important part of my practice, which is inherently social. Apart from it's communicative nature, humour is the unexpected tipping point between the ludacris and the grotesque. Play with affective poles is central to my work. My sense of humour is used to side-eye rational and/or hegemonic processes. I hope that my work creates moments of confusion and discomfort, which I feel are fertile spaces for growth and understanding. ","I was a part of a group show in 2011 called Ululology. The show was a quasi-response to the Occupy Movement, which was quite active at that time. Myself and five other sound artists worked independently on projects and periodically shared our progress with one another. At the end of a few weeks, our work was placed in the same gallery space. None of the works were made for headphones, so the possibility of being heard was constantly negotiated. The volumes were altered daily to create different relationships and reconstruct the space. My project was an extremely loud, deep bass piece which vibrated the only seating in the room, and a sound track of shaking tea sets.","I aspire to live in a communal home in the future but have not been able to as of yet. I've stayed in hostels on a number of occasions for majority of my travelling, the longest being a 14 day stay in Vancouver. I feel that I can successfully read the room and respect the needs of those around me. I prefer to share space with others and have never had any issues with listening and communication or sharing responsibilities. I am a very clean and hardworking housemate. ","The poles of nature and culture are present in both my art practice and my research. My explorations of the supernatural always return to the laws of nature, religious institutions, essence and the body. How can something exist outside of nature if nature is all encompassing? What does it mean for something to be alive or not? In what ways is History, that is to say the forward facing path of civilization, distinct from muscle memory and memory in general? 

For my MA research, I analyze the dissemination of an urban, self-identified ""half-breed"" indigenous filmmaker named Ariel Smith. Her videos question naivety and gender performances. I am using the trickster figure as a framework for her artistic practice and the sneaky, somewhat non-human characters in her work.  

Also, I feel that the living experience itself will be a part of processing the theme. I am very excited to have the opportunity to express myself and learn from others in a communal environment. ",,"I would love to see underwater, underground or avian series of performances. The performances could be in fox-like dens, large bird nests or a windowless, flying, brick room. ","What is your favourite word? 

A friend of mine, who is a writer, once used the word mezzochist to describe me. The word is meant to describe someone or something which experiences pleasure from occupying a middle ground. It is closely followed by the word misty. ",,"A friend, Lauren Fournier",None
