I was born in Moscow_COMMA_ Russia. My practice is organizational and curatorial : in Toronto I run a number of organizations that explore alternative approaches to image making_COMMA_ production_COMMA_ and consumption. I am interested in subverting traditional templates within the art system. I enjoy nature and physical challenge. Once I biked from Toronto to Montreal with a dog.,In my practice_COMMA_ i often crowd source to fill in the gaps or as the focus of a project. I have had several projects involving large group of people that are activated by participation. In a way_COMMA_ part of my work as artist-curator involves the construction of an alternate reality occupied by the artists and art projects that i become involved with. my work in publications and performance is often extremely collaborative_COMMA_ and I am a member of a number of loose collectives.,One example of a collaborative practice is my project Rearviews: a review is reviewed and that review is reviewed again by a string of people_COMMA_ like an exquisite corpse or a broken telephone. this eventually constitutes a publication. In the broken string of reviews are narrative that evolve between the reviewers_COMMA_ and which ultimately require collaborative support. In this project_COMMA_ people reveal themselves as tending to engage in a joined narrative that connects them as characters_COMMA_ not reviewers.,I the summers of 2012 and 2011 I have spent a while in a local residency started by my friends and i called Don Blanche. In this residency_COMMA_ we would execute a number of art projects - some sculpture_COMMA_ some performance_COMMA_ some installation. we also built a sauna and a hot tub from scratch_COMMA_ and made a beach by ordering a lot of sand. everyone lived on cots in tents or in one big dorm and share space and meals. the residency would have between 18-40 people in it at any given time_COMMA_ it would last for 2 weeks.,i am interested in improvised delivery of projects _COMMA_ which seems inevitable in the hike scenario. I like that it involves movement of both time and space_COMMA_ conceptually_COMMA_ this is interesting to me. I am also looking forward to becoming inspired by the mobility and physical activity involved - its refreshing to have a summit or a conference in a mobile format.,something i would be interested in is the subject of score - through looking at a number of film/musical scores from hitchcock to john cage_COMMA_ I would be very interested in talking about the visual representation and importance of the score_COMMA_ as not only a document but a map.

It is exciting for me when I end up with something completely unexpected. I rarely consider any part of my process as a mistake_COMMA_ because in the end_COMMA_ no matter where I go_COMMA_ I have learned and explored something new. Being fully immersed in a community that leaves room for progressive discovery has taught me that the only way to make work is to make work. Period.

Evaluating natural commonalities between these small places_COMMA_ I begin to develop an idea_COMMA_ and then move into the act of editing and clarifying the idea. Said created order can be built alone or collectively. Both approaches are always moving forward_COMMA_ naturally moving into an idea. Editing and clarifying the idea is best done collectively_COMMA_ with many different perspectives from others. Upon clarifying created ideas_COMMA_ work is made.

Materials become the means by which we communicate_COMMA_ becoming a substitute for one to one sincere communication of our emotions. Through objects we jump to conclusions about identity_COMMA_ rather than slowly engaging with the newness of the other. In short_COMMA_ objects become proxies for others and control our experiences with others._NEWLINE_My work is tangible in order to be confrontational. I work to coerce viewers to regard everyday objects in a new light. In this body of work_COMMA_ I am taking objects laden with feminine expectations_COMMA_ altering them into a silhouette of color_COMMA_ and re appropriating them into a substitution for women.

My background is in sculpture and I really enjoy learning about building and fabrication. For the past 8 years I have worked two dimensionally and the last three years specifically in painting and printmaking. For the past five years I also worked as the Director of a non-profit arts organization in NYC and now work as a freelance grant writer and consultant for artists and organizations. I am also an avid cyclist and take long rides upstate as much as possible. I have a penchant for American History and read a lot of books on various topics of war_COMMA_ Native Americans_COMMA_ slavery and the psychology of killing (as it relates to war and ritual).,I rely on collaboration in various ways_COMMA_ but primarily through having a wide range of people through my studio for visits where we talk about art_COMMA_ painting_COMMA_ my paintings and many other things_COMMA_ sometimes only indirectly related to art. The people who participate in studio visits range from artists_COMMA_ curators_COMMA_ galleriest and collectors to writers_COMMA_ musicians_COMMA_ and non-artists. I have collaborated in the past in a more traditional sense that involved equal input on creative and aesthetic fronts. Also_COMMA_ because painting can be a relatively solitary practice_COMMA_ I have side projects I work on making zines and collaborating in a variety of ways using the zine format as the basis for development.,In 2009 I collaborated with artist Heather Willems for an outdoor project hosted by Art In Odd Places_COMMA_ NYC. Together we built more than 60 individual letters of the alphabet (50 inches tall) as soft sculptures that were paraded down 14th Street by volunteers and then arranged to spell several different empowering phrases once we reached Union Square. If was a fun project and got more interesting when the public wanted to join in and start spelling their own phrases and words. Below is a website we set up for the project and a link to an interview we did at Union Square. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_http://loudspeakerpresents.wordpress.com/tag/jenn-dierdorf/_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtGR75T24M8,Art related communal living experiences would include the 3 residency programs I've participated in. Each was very different in the way they were set up and how much interaction was encouraged in each_COMMA_ but in all three the relationships I built during my time there was important and continue today. I really enjoy and benefit from communal environments_COMMA_ but usually due to work_COMMA_ studio and other obligations I dont have much time to devote to nurturing those types of relationships/environments for myself. I would welcome the opportunity to meet new people_COMMA_ learn and share about things and have provocative conversations. I get along easily with others and am generally flexible and have the ability to adapt to new situations well.,I think that completing a 50 mile hike with a group of interesting people I've never met will be a fun challenge. I'm interested in what I may find along the way_COMMA_ in terms of new things_COMMA_ things I can learn about myself and about others. I think its important to change your environment from time to time and that a disruption in a routine can make room for new things in interesting ways. I deliberately instigate disruptions for myself_COMMA_ however this experience would give me less control over the situation (who is there_COMMA_where we are_COMMA_ what we're doing) and that interests me.,"My initial thought for a project of this nature_COMMA_ and something dear to me that I could share with a group would be that I could host an ongoing ""storytelling"" event throughout the hike._NEWLINE__NEWLINE__NEWLINE_ I have read an extensive amount on the history of New York City_COMMA_ the whaling industry in the U.S.and the ship wreck of the ESSEX (the story the Moby Dick is written about)_COMMA_ abolitionists_COMMA_ the Gold Rush_COMMA_ and much more. I find specific stories related to these topics reveal an intimacy and connection that remove some of the distance between our contemporary selves and the ancestors that created that history. They are also incredibly fascinating stories! I would probably select a story for each night of the hike and research the topics in order to put together a concise story to tell. Each story could be organized in to a category to be considered_COMMA_ i.e. ""The 9 Levels of Hell"" (Dante's Inferno) or ""The 5 Hindrances"" (Buddhist thought).",,List three new things you've learned in the past year.

I am hardworking and inquisitive. I swim in the ocean when it’s cold outside. I am buoyant and carry a strong optimism. I look to wonder and possibility. I like to wake up early_COMMA_ early enough_COMMA_ just before the sun gets up because then it is like we are getting up together. I open the curtains and observe the beginning. I like to get outside first thing_COMMA_ check in with the air; most often I do this by bike. I grew up in Watsonville_COMMA_ CA at the bottom of the Santa Cruz Mountains_COMMA_ across from raspberry fields. I moved south as an adolescent and back up north to Olympia for university at The Evergreen State College. This is where I really started to develop my relationship to thinking and making_COMMA_ thinking as a making. Now I live in Oakland_COMMA_ CA where I share house with my partner and 6 other people; I rent and share studio space in Chinatown. My studio is a thinking room. I go here to collect my experiences and perceptions and turn them into questions or remarks. My day jobs are on either sides of Chinatown at a coffee warehouse facility and a farmers market. These places all form a constellation that is my sanctuary.,I see my way of thinking and making as collaborative. Not only in the kinds of art that I am producing but also in how I think about what art is. I think about art as something whose value is found in process or in the making. The work that is interesting for me to make is that which is experience oriented or that which exists in the direct engagement of someone with the work. Often times when I am constructing something_COMMA_ I am thinking about a conversation that I want to have and the work becomes the prelude to that conversation as well as evidence of it. Through my practice_COMMA_ I begin to make a trail that weaves in and out of objects and experiences_COMMA_ out of sitting and reading_COMMA_ to drawing and teaching. The practice that I have is kind of like thinking because it is never really over_COMMA_ it is an exploration; it is inquisitive.,I recently went to Iceland. I wanted to go to a very isolated place to investigate if you can experience a landscape paying attention to you or if you can only experience a landscape paying attention to itself. This question developed in tandem with a fascination for ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response). Most causes of this sensation are mundane: whispering_COMMA_ chewing_COMMA_ getting a haircut_COMMA_ unpredictable movement_COMMA_ etc. and produce an intense tingling sensation in the back of the neck_COMMA_ on the head_COMMA_ and other places on the body. The sensation is distinctly non-sexual. People are experiencing intense pleasure from watching and engaging in activities where nothing really happens. It is not about the action that is taking place but what state of attention these mundane actions have to offer. There seems to be an underlying practice of empathy that this kind of engagement has to offer. I am drawn to this community that has formed around participation in nothing and I would like to explore what else there is to learn from it.I have been making a series of experiments based on my Iceland adventure and ASMR research. I created a performance in which someone sits down at a table_COMMA_ puts on headphones and is then guided through peeling and cutting a potato. I sit across from them and watch.,I currently live in house with my partner_COMMA_ 6 other people_COMMA_ and Shasta_COMMA_ the dog. All of us are in our mid-twenties to early thirties and are social justice_COMMA_ direct service oriented. We have a big backyard with three raised garden beds. Kevin and I grow a variety of vegetables for the house. We all share food and upkeep responsibilities. We cook for each other and we gather once a month for a meeting. We don’t have a lot of firm cooking/cleaning structures but we all respect the space and each other and our house reflects that. Since moving here 6 months ago_COMMA_ I have really enjoyed the sense of support and care that comes with sharing a living space. At times_COMMA_ I have also found it challenging to live in a social environment where sometimes have to compromise time alone. Ultimately_COMMA_ I feel so lucky to share the space I do with this group of people and for how I continue to grow through the experience.,The question “How can one make thinking?” is one that drives my practice. At this time in my life_COMMA_ I find that I explore this question and I mostly explore it alone. Since returning to SF Bay Area_COMMA_ I have built a strong community and yet I have struggled to find people who engage in making as a practice of thinking like I do. A lot of the people_COMMA_ artists among them that I have built strong alliances with here_COMMA_ are more material driven in their work. This has been an ongoing challenge for me because of how much I enjoy the exploration and collaborative engagement that comes from discussion and work that is defined by its nature of being unfinished. I largely focus on making thinking and ways of knowing visible and I would strongly benefit from looking at unmaking thinking and making unthinking_COMMA_ etc._NEWLINE_I am also really drawn to where both teachers-in-residence_COMMA_ Benjamin Korta and Danièle Bourque_COMMA_ are coming from_COMMA_ specifically their respective relationships to Zen and spiritual care. Attention and awareness have been strong guiding principles in my work and I would be interested in working with people whose work is founded in these concepts.,,I would take the work that I have been doing with the ocean and explore it in the context of unthinking/unknowing with the other residents. I would have us all go to the ocean for 2 days and run a series of exercises to practice making the sound of the ocean at different points along the shore; presumably different sounds for different places. At each place we would gather a part of the ocean to bring back with us to the residence. There_COMMA_ we would place our large samples of Atlantic Ocean into big_COMMA_ quiet freezers. When the ocean will have frozen_COMMA_ we would set the different samples in a large room on the floor and sing the sound of the different ocean homes that we had learned from our practice_COMMA_ slowly the sea water would melt and the performers would come to face each other making their respective sounds of the ocean.,At what point is the ocean not the ocean? _NEWLINE_The ocean will always be the ocean_COMMA_ even when it is only salt,I don’t foresee any scheduling conflicts. I may like to have a visitor or two.,Willy Smart,Broccoli

I received my BA in Fine Art from London Central Saint Martins College of Art & Design._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Although my practice is irrefutably linked to photography_COMMA_ it embraces the sculptural. At its core lies a preoccupation for the photograph’s conflictive nature as both a body in space and an image’s carrier. Moreover_COMMA_ within my work there is always the aim to further understand how information is structured_COMMA_ specifically within visual and physical frameworks_COMMA_ and how we maneuver our way through these information systems. I am interested in the role memory and culture play in our reading of both images and objects_COMMA_ and art production’s relation to this as a gradual reshuffling of cultural forms through their strategic re-use and transformation._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_My work has been previously exhibited in several exhibitions throughout London_COMMA_ such as ""Rare Gifts"" at The Residence Gallery (London_COMMA_ 2012)_COMMA_ ""TRACE"" at Frameless Gallery (London_COMMA_ 2012)_COMMA_ “Inhabited (Flatfile) at Artspace (New Haven_COMMA_ 2013) and “Digital Ground” at Ely Slade House for Contemporary art (New Haven_COMMA_ 2013).etc. In 2011 her work was shortlisted for the BARTUR Award in Photography_COMMA_ and was also shortlisted for the Zeitgeist Open 2012. .

My work is currently being exhibited as part of Artspace NH’s Crown St Window Project (Feb-March ’14) as well as a within four month project at the Young Men’s Institute (New Haven_COMMA_ CT). Additionally I am now working on curating a show for the YMI’S Gallery_COMMA_ which will open this May.",Intellectually my practice is fed by the contemporary art flux and is influence by its context. I find that maintaining a dialogue about my ideas related to my work is key to my thought structuring process. Conversations makeup the intellectual feeding and testing ground for my ideas/projects. Thus_COMMA_ I try to have regular studio visits and I have a weekly skype session with another artist with whom I have collaborated on various joint projects. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I have previously collaborated and shared authorship over larger works and in curating exhibitions. Ei: with Isabelle Gressel_COMMA_ I created the Unhomely Project. This work consisted of a public domestic environment using temporary donations of personal home items and functioned as an art installation._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Likewise_COMMA_ part of my practice seeks to question who is the audience and what is their role_COMMA_ implicating others directly within my work. Ei: In The Postcard Project_COMMA_ people close to me with whom I’ve share an experience_COMMA_ receive (without any prior notice) a post-card with an snapshot of the event_COMMA_ shaping the work and becoming the work’s primary audience. Meanwhile those external to the work must rely solely on the description of the project and their imagination_COMMA_ functioning as a secondary audience. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Similarly_COMMA_ I am currently working on curating a show that will be the end result of an postal art project titled “Por Oaxaca”. Here I have sent a selection artists from different backgrounds/countries a photograph and asked them to respond to the image without any further instructions or information on the photograph. My aim is to question my role as an author of a piece_COMMA_ while incorporating various narrative voices_COMMA_ and question how cultural and social factors affect our reading of a culturally loaded image. Only the artworks produced by the participant artist will be displayed within the exhibition.,My current series in progress would very much represent the thought_COMMA_ research_COMMA_ and making process that take place within my practice. This series_COMMA_ titled Maroon Bells and Paradise_COMMA_ plays with fragmenting photography’s materiality_COMMA_ both physical and/or digital. The series is composed of a set of photograms made-up of downloaded_COMMA_ pixilated_COMMA_ and recomposed landscape photographs from notable photographers. In these there is a use of abundant texture and image distortion meant as strategies of reappraising the history of landscape composition_COMMA_ while confronting the viewer with a screen that allows no visual progression into it. Its aim is very much to place the viewer in a state of already knowing (having encountered images in this state of decomposition_COMMA_ as much a landscape images prior to this) conscious or unconsciously_COMMA_ and unknowing given that he can’t make any logical sense of what the image is as a whole. Given that he is presented with a screen of information that contains no given structure to order the viewing experience. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The series aims to play with shared images (abundant in our contemporary media society) and strategies of appropriation. It would also address the contemporary erosion of visual data_COMMA_ contesting the relationship between digital and analogue manipulation. Likewise it looks into the visual and physical frameworks that structure our engagement with reality. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_My aims to question the false utopia of access and commonality advertized by contemporary image media. The paradox of the digital and image era is that it ultimately denies us any entry_COMMA_ visual or tactile_COMMA_ into the universe of screens that compose it. We are constantly in a state of knowing/unknowing. The series spotlights our shallow visual reading skills and our contemporary understanding of reality based on a myriad of images in which we have no real presence,Besides having lived with multiple flat-mates and going to summer camp as a kid_COMMA_ was going to boarding school as a teenager was the most intense experience and condensed communal living experience. I went to a co-ed school_COMMA_ where dormitories were male/female only_COMMA_ but we could invite boys over to our ‘living room’. In addition_COMMA_ I had to share my bedroom and the dormitory had communal bathrooms. This meant that we spent all day with a closed group of people sharing every moment from breakfast to afterschool sports_COMMA_ and even field trips to the local cinema. Although the experience was intense_COMMA_ it was very rewarding. I made some long-term friendships there and became much more tolerant and flexible towards others personalities_COMMA_ needs_COMMA_ and beliefs. Furthermore living and going to class with the same group of people benefited my learning process_COMMA_ my friends were more open to discuss school topics as dinner conversations and help out each other in areas one was falling behind. Boarding school became a stepping-stone in my coming of age_COMMA_ helping me gain some independence from family life and shaping myself as an individual within a social context.,I feel the need to reconsider my processes in relation to my artistic concerns_COMMA_ and how they are understood in and across different social_COMMA_ artistic and intellectual contexts. Being in a collaborative environment with artists across disciplines would open my artistic horizons. The arising conversations will provide a testing ground for my ideas and spur my practice forward._NEWLINE_Being in such an environment would force me to re-appraise my innate structured thinking and creating logic that seeks to order and accommodate an incessant amount of thoughts. Although I am mentally flexible and can adapt to variety of thinking environments_COMMA_ having a mixture of lecture_COMMA_ physical-psychological exercises_COMMA_ creative and collaborative time will allow me to gain a perspective on my own work which unattainable to me at the moment. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Moreover_COMMA_ the concept of unthinking/unknowing_COMMA_ in relation to that of entry and being held at bay by art as well as an understanding of emptiness and totality (infinite) at one point being equivalent_COMMA_ have been and are prevalent through out my practice.,,I would produce one of the immersive image-environment installations that I have been recently planning. This would be composed of self-standing wooden walls_COMMA_ laid out overlapping each other. These would be placed in the middle of the gallery_COMMA_ emphasizing the work’s sculptural nature and allowing the audience to both walk between the panels and stand back to see the work as a one whole composition. The installation would address the visual and physical frameworks that structure our engagement with space_COMMA_ exploring how art historical notions like perspective and the picturesque have been carried forward through the prevalence of contemporary image-media. _NEWLINE_Likewise_COMMA_ I’ve been thinking of having an image/s printed on curtains. The images would be representations of either landscape or architecture_COMMA_ blown up to almost a 1.1 ratio. Within our contemporary media we constantly engage with ‘image milieus’ where we have no real physical presence – a constant interplay between entry and referral. Printing on curtains would allow the audience to walk through the image_COMMA_ seemingly entering it_COMMA_ while paradoxically emphasizing the surface nature of images. The audience would thus engage on a physical level with the image_COMMA_ spotlighting the images’ dependence on a medium/body and their screen-like presence.,What is a good_COMMA_ note-worthy question to ask and answer? Unfortunately no good question can be given one straightforward answer_COMMA_ at least within my personal thought process. Answers are dependent of the context_COMMA_ the depth of the response_COMMA_ as much as the person answering subjectivity and cultural_COMMA_ socio-economic background.

While I push myself in my own mediums and ideas_COMMA_ time and maturity has taught me that an individual is always susceptible to lack of foresight and tunnel vision. Others can always offer counter opinions and different perspectives. Not to mention that others will be able to fill in the gaps of another's knowledge and skill set. With this in mind I actively pursue collaborators. Also the nature of working with materials small and large scale requires a crew like mentality. A hand is always needed for my work_COMMA_ and a hand is always ready to be lent for others.,I would say that my recent work with clay forms that interact with plants would represent me as an artist fit for your program. I think this for two reasons in particular. First is that this work is very much derived from nature. Clay as a material is derived from the earth and conveys the beauty and chaotic order of the natural world. And the second reason pertains to their concepts_COMMA_ all of which deal with the artist working in unison with nature. One series of clay objects was four orbs that are cultivating succulents and presenting them in interesting ways. Another is a series of terrariums that bring bits of nature into an interior space and are presented stylistically as if the housed moss or plant had a unique personality. Another_COMMA_ is a sub-irrigated planter that waters plants through a cotton wick from a well below the soil. Projects I would do in your residency would be ones more feasible to do on site such as drawing/painting or woodcarvings_COMMA_ but I would do them in the same vein as these works in clay._NEWLINE_ It seems that residents in your program use their interactions with nature to think abstractly. i am very interested in doing this_COMMA_ as well as interacting with others interested in the same thing._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_http://www.davecustodio.com/ceramics.html,My current living and working situation is an artist collective of sorts. It is a group of like minded individuals who each has their own skills and ideas to bring to the table. though it is often hard to deal with clashing egos_COMMA_ we are always determined to find common ground with each other. With persistent mutual respect_COMMA_ honesty_COMMA_ and support_COMMA_ it seems that we create a kind of magic together.,I often contemplate issues of nature vs. nurture. I think about what can be said of our true selves. Is it something that lies in our instincts that we are born with? are the values and practices that are cultured within us derived from truth or are they deviations from such? are we moving towards disharmony with nature? or are we functioning in our own natural fashion even if it is expressed destructively or in a synthetic way? A course on reconstructing wildness reads to me as a course in getting in touch with one's primitive roots. I feel that I attempt this in my own work. Being immersed in an environment that is conducive to this process_COMMA_ with others who are looking to do the same_COMMA_ will bring us closer to understanding these issues.,I feel that my specialties lie in materials. I know that the woodland catskills are fertile with a variety of interesting materials that are untouched by the human ego. If given the lead of a workshop I would challenge my peers to use and interact with found materials in their natural state. How can we harmonize ourselves with natural order using the material that comes from the trees_COMMA_ the ground_COMMA_ rocks_COMMA_ the animals_COMMA_ etc? This could be similar to what our ancestors did_COMMA_ or something new and personal. In what ways are the materials that are organic and not synthesized different from man made ones that we interact with everyday and all the time? What feelings do they evoke? We can present crafted items_COMMA_ performances_COMMA_ etc. we can also have discussions about the social implications of these materials and what that says about our own human nature._NEWLINE_ These are things that I think about in my own work and it would be of interest to me to involve others in this conversation.,It would have to be something large scale and structural. I often create art that exists within a space_COMMA_ but more and more i think about the space as being the art. I would build something that would coexist with the natural environment and fit within it aesthetically. Ive done work with a post and beam builder in the past_COMMA_ and to me_COMMA_ it is a kind of structural ideal. The wood is an environmentally friendly material and post and beam is simple_COMMA_ strong_COMMA_ and beautiful. I could see myself constructing a post and beam structure that the viewer can interact with by actually being inside. It could be large enough to fit within and small enough to be intimate and able to be made in a timely manner.,How can we find meaning in a meaningless world?_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Create it.,scheduling shouldn't be a problem_COMMA_ my work hours are flexible.,the res artis website,i'm not particular but i try to eat healthy

I make sound_COMMA_ sculptural and musical artworks. In addition to being an artist_COMMA_ I work as a librarian. For as long as I can remember_COMMA_ I have always wanted to be an artist. My father was a hobby painter. I grew up in a semi-rural small town in Ontario Canada. Being outside and close to nature has always been important to me. I like camping and hiking. I also like cooking_COMMA_ traveling_COMMA_ drinking beer in pubs_COMMA_ drinking wine at friend's places_COMMA_ drinking coffee in cafes_COMMA_ watching movies with my wife_COMMA_ going for walks with my daughter_COMMA_ walking my dog_COMMA_ reading_COMMA_ listening to music_COMMA_ listening to music loud in my living room and dancing with my wife and daughter (the dog doesn't understand dancing). I like all kinds of music. I like all kinds of art. I think art and music are of the greatest and most hopeful things that people can do_COMMA_ which is why I keep doing it.,I have been involved with a few collaborative projects_COMMA_ particularly with making music. I find collaborative experiences to be very generative and rewarding. The more sculptural work that I am doing now is not highly collaborative but there are elements: I prefer to work in an group/social studio space and have colleagues around to discuss ideas_COMMA_ art and the world around us. I find my ideas develop when I've been talking about them. When I am working on a major project_COMMA_ I likewise prefer to have people around me to give input (and a helping hand) and this always ends up influencing the art I make. I do have one fully collaborative project that I am involved with currently_COMMA_ which is an extension of a project started ten years ago. A friend and I started making noise-music together with a freeform_COMMA_ totally improvised_COMMA_ process driven approach. Back then we were next door neighbours_COMMA_ now we live on different continents and the project is based on trying to maintain this improvised approach through technology.,The Pink Glass Swans was the noise band that I started with a friend mentioned above. Our goal was to work within a very minimal framework to allow for_COMMA_ as much as possible_COMMA_ a totally free-improvised sound at the borders of noise and music. This was achieved through an agreed upon process_COMMA_ which had the effect of stopping any discussion of what we were making and to focus only making in the moment and only communicating through making. The framework was represented by the situation: a medium sized room containing a robust array of sound intoning objects and amplifying devices ranging from the conventional (guitars)_COMMA_ the novel (kids toys)_COMMA_ the quotidian (pots and pans)_COMMA_ and the specialized (electronic effects processors); a routine- meeting every week at around the same time for about the same amount of time; and a way of documenting (usually a cassette recorder). The process followed a set of “rules”: anyone can make this music_COMMA_ any object that can be used to make sound can be used_COMMA_ nothing is decided beforehand_COMMA_ listen and respond to what you hear_COMMA_ and play it loud. We invited people to joins us_COMMA_ some regulars others only once or twice_COMMA_ and what happened was everyone present just started_COMMA_ either clapping or strumming or banging or turning on and off a radio and then for the next few hours the sound would build in waves as patterns developed and dissolved_COMMA_ and as people freely moved around the room picking something up or plugging something in and playing it until something urged them to change. The recording was an important part of the “noise jam” and often we would listen to the entire recording right away in order to reflect on what was made. At the time of this project I was influenced by free jazz_COMMA_ and in particular the political ideals of anarchy and freedom embodied in the music_COMMA_ and also the spiritual aspects of the music. The Pink Glass Swans project was for me one of the most influential artmaking experiences of my life. http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Glass+Swans,As part of travelling_COMMA_ my wife and I have volunteered on farms (through the WWOOF organization). One such experience in Italy had about ten of us living together in one barn/loft_COMMA_ eating large communal meals and working together in the fields. We were there for two weeks. It was all organized by the host so we didn't have to plan much_COMMA_ just how to be together. We had a wonderful time. I also think of sharing studio space as a type of communal living_COMMA_ which I have been doing on and off for ten years or so.,I do not know how the hike will aid my artistic development_COMMA_ which is why I like the idea. I do know that I find it productive to walk and think_COMMA_ also I find it beneficial to go and come back. I like the doing aspect of this hike- planning_COMMA_ traveling_COMMA_ walking_COMMA_ talking_COMMA_ meeting new people- a departure_COMMA_ which at this time is something I am seeking_COMMA_ but not just any trip_COMMA_ I am seeking something which brings a dedicated focus to thinking about my art practice and discussing/experiencing it with other likeminded seekers in hopes of finding something new_COMMA_ something yet unthought of. I will bring a portable audio recorder with me and these recordings could potentially be the basis of a new artwork._NEWLINE_Reconstructing Wildness has a similar appeal_COMMA_ however I'm imagining this departure will lead to a very different part of the woods. Part of my attraction to noise is the wildness of it; the way you can submerge yourself in it_COMMA_ lose yourself in it. This is a rare experience. I am very interested in exploring self-transcendence in different ways and connecting it to ideas of wildness is very intriguing. Religious experience and expression has been a long time interest of mine and I have been recently been thinking about transcendence_COMMA_ especially in relation to religious practices which focus on mind-body-self connection. I have experimented with meditation_COMMA_ yoga and chakra opening to limited degrees_COMMA_ as I always find a disconnect between these established practices and the modern world. The complexity and contradiction of seeking spirituality within modernity has recently been influencing my art. I think there is a connection with this line of thinking and the direction proposed for Reconstructing Wildness.,Following R. Murray Schafer_COMMA_ who developed many of the ideas of what is known as acoustic ecology_COMMA_ I will lead a workshop on structured listening. This will involve a brief talk on acoustic ecology_COMMA_ reading a bit of Schafer's writing and then proceeding as a group to follow some of the listening exercises designed by him. The most well known of Schafer's exercise is the sound walk_COMMA_ which is a focused listening of an environment experienced by moving through it_COMMA_ and is often followed up with a discussion of what was heard.,I envision a SMT session in immersive sound and listening. One aspect would be noise making- setting up a situation for free improvisation with musical instruments and other sound making devices and amplifiers and microphones. Also listening workshops like sound walks_COMMA_ as described above. Another aspect could be something influenced by sound therapy and how sound vibration is used in healing- creating immersive sound environments/situations for the purpose of immersive listening_COMMA_ but also to work with participant's practices_COMMA_ such as creating sound for a performance_COMMA_ or sound to go with painting.,What are a few things influencing your thoughts and art making recently? Installation artist Mike Nelson_COMMA_ composer Terry Riley_COMMA_ Tibetan Buddhism_COMMA_ psychedelia_COMMA_ the 1970s_COMMA_ aesthetics_COMMA_ Godzilla movies_COMMA_ listening to my music collection on random_COMMA_ J. G. Ballard short stories_COMMA_ early abstract painting_COMMA_ walking through the city.,There is nothing as far as scheduling conflicts_COMMA_ however I may wish to schedule a departure mid way through to meet with my wife and daughter_COMMA_ or they could come visit me. My daughter is one and half years old and I would find three weeks to be a long time to be away from my family.,Online through searching for art residencies (but I forget which website in particular) or the instant coffee listserv,I do not have any specific restrictions or allergies but as much as possible I prefer to eat whole foods_COMMA_ naturally/organically raised_COMMA_ no preservatives... that kind of thing.

I'm a lovable Leo sign_COMMA_ who is loyal and respectful. Last year I did a lot of drawing_COMMA_ note taking and thinking. This year I want to draw/write some comics_COMMA_ but I also have a bunch of performances lined up. _NEWLINE_I am pretty focused on making art these days_COMMA_ but I also have to deal with surviving capitalism_COMMA_ systematic oppression_COMMA_ etc. and that can cut into my creative energies. I'd like to be able to cut off these concerns for a few weeks_COMMA_ hang out with smarty pants art folk and soak in the wilderness at the Yellow House.,I have been doing various media projects with queer folks: coordinating the Slippery Slope Cabaret_COMMA_ hosting a radio show/ interviewing trans*artists and activists_COMMA_ and engaging in the youtube community. Interacting with people and having meaningful conversation inspires my practice as a writer and thinker. _NEWLINE_Of course_COMMA_ my social interactions can also be full of hilarious misunderstandings or micro-aggressions that are just as inspiring to my art and thinking. Queerness and social critique is a large part of my practice.,http://morgansea.wordpress.com/performance-work/super-powers-the-slide-show/_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_It’s a piece that talks about my trans experience and queer politics with the question_COMMA_ “Which super power would you choose and why?” It gets pretty funny as_COMMA_ during the performance_COMMA_ I have a sort of existential crisis trying to find out if I am more into Shapeshifting or Telepathy. With shapeshifting_COMMA_ I could be as visually appealing as I wanted to be_COMMA_ gain various degrees of privilege_COMMA_ and explore amazing possibilities with a super-fluid queer body. With telepathy_COMMA_ I could change people’s minds and subtly shift their social-political views with persuasive comments that cater to their subconscious. However_COMMA_ could I trust myself not to straight up re-write their brain? What are the consent issues involved in telepathy? Which would I choose now? I still don’t know. Scratch that_COMMA_ shapeshifting_COMMA_ totally.,I attended SMT in 2012. I really enjoyed the cooking_COMMA_ the conversation_COMMA_ and the creative peoples. I’ve also lived with a lot of roommates and generally aim to please within a communal space.,Session B_COMMA_ Unthinking/Unknowing sounds really good to me. The physicality of the Bourque's class sounds like a good way to break from my urban habitual laze and enter the space with an active body and mind._NEWLINE_The unthinkable makes me think concepts or ideas that have become unspeakable_COMMA_ removed from societies lexicon. This seems like a good thing to meditate on an add to my queer theory toolkit in my ongoing battle with hegemonic oppression! _NEWLINE_I'm excited to explore Deleuzian concepts and think Bourque's background experience teaching contemporary mythology would benefit my own practice which often queers ancient mythology_COMMA_ archetypes_COMMA_ and contemporary mythology.,,I would like to make a series of short videos or photographic essays exploring the hierarchy of Daedalus and the Minotaur . (Daedalus the greek mythological inventor not only built the apparatus for the Cretian Queen to mate with a bull_COMMA_ he also designed the Labyrinth that the beast man would spend his life in.

I work within boundaries based on a conceptual logic_COMMA_ submitting to patterns and structures that exist naturally. I search for and collect connections and contradictions. I misuse materials and re-appropriate objects. I engage in futile gestures to provoke confusion_COMMA_ seeking out the awareness that occurs through redundancy and subverted functionality. I question when and where art really exists. I collaborate with groups of people as an instigator and facilitator. I challenge cliches and play games with words. I build the box and ask for others to step out of it.,One of my most recent artistic endeavors has been teaching. Last summer I taught a process and idea generation class for 9 to 12 year olds at the Rochester Art Center in Minnesota. While the class at the RAC was for young students_COMMA_ the projects and class structure are similar to activities that I would like to facilitate with adults. I like to act as an amateur teacher_COMMA_ a teacher that knows less than the students. I pose questions with no answers and instigate conversation. The project at the RAC examined a playful logic and encouraged students to draw conclusions and make connections between seemingly unlike things_COMMA_ while working within a given set of restrictions. _NEWLINE_My curating project_COMMA_ POWERPOINT_COMMA_ also represents my system of working within a set of invented boundaries. For this exhibition I solicited works by artists and non-artists created using only PowerPoint. The show resulted in a collection of 2D images_COMMA_ animations_COMMA_ slide shows_COMMA_ sculptures and books. The boundaries set by the program brought limitations that_COMMA_ through operation_COMMA_ provoked a consciousness of the making process and ultimately dictated the product.,Aside from living with roommates throughout college_COMMA_ I have attended summer camp_COMMA_ worked as a summer camp counselor_COMMA_ and volunteered on farms_COMMA_ all of which I was living with and sharing space with others. The most communal living experience I have had was volunteering on farms in Minnesota_COMMA_ Holland and Belgium_COMMA_ where I contributed daily to the homestead by cooking_COMMA_ cleaning_COMMA_ building_COMMA_ and working in the gardens and fields along the other volunteers and farmers.,I believe the collaborative and kinetic nature of the School of Making and Thinking would have an extremely positive impact on my practice. Summit on a Summit_COMMA_ specifically_COMMA_ would be a beautiful opportunity to challenge myself physically_COMMA_ observe myself _COMMA_ learn from others and escape my everyday. On the hike_COMMA_ I would hope to challenge my improvisation skills_COMMA_ and focus on becoming more aware of the moments that I enter a most thoughtful state of mind.,Making Assumptions & Drawing Conclusions Workshop:_NEWLINE_We will each choose a random object found in nature. These objects will become our readymades for which we would generate a title and artist statement/manifesto/description/poem. Based only on what we can glean from the found object we will assign it meaning and determine it's function as an art object. Our tools would be signs and symbols_COMMA_ metaphors and analogies. We would conclude the workshop with a presentation and conversation about the works.,"I would like to do a series of small interventions_COMMA_ experiments and exercises with others and by myself that respond to and question the environment. I am unsure if this would result in a ""final product"" or if it would exist as a continuous performance of sorts. My project would hopefully represent the group as a whole and the individuals within.",Q: Is this art? _NEWLINE_A: I don't know.,I do not have any scheduling conflicts this summer.,Facebook,I eat all foods.

Prior to undertaking my MFA_COMMA_ I completed an MA at the Centre for Drama_COMMA_ theatre and Performance Studies_COMMA_ University of Toronto_COMMA_ in 2012. My research and creative practice explores identity and belonging_COMMA_ juggling with my experience as an interdisciplinary artist/researcher/human being in an increasingly homogenized society. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The focus of my artistic practice lies in willess acts of self-affirmation around space (public and private)_COMMA_ time_COMMA_ and identity. I am interested in revisiting place by reconfiguring our conception and use of space in the everyday through scored and task-oriented actions. The body becomes the site for my exploration_COMMA_ while repetition_COMMA_ endurance and resistance test the physical and emotional boundaries of my corporeal matter. Working at the edges of discomfort and vulnerability_COMMA_ I continuously re-evaluate the threshold of my body as it breaks down and rebuilds to become a site for change and exchange. I perform the friction of skin against architecture and nature. My hope is to generate knowledge through acts that most have discarded as unfeasible_COMMA_ unthinkable_COMMA_ and absurd. Embodying text and challenging language are fundamental to addressing identity and posing critical perspectives on authority._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I am a long distance runner and I am a lover of the outdoors. When not focusing on my research and practice_COMMA_ I enjoy all types of physical activity and exertion. Throughout my life I have actively participated in team sports since they fulfill my need for exchange and community while practicing physical exercise. In the past three years_COMMA_ I have sought opportunities to bridge my practice/research with my enthusiasm for the outdoors through play and collaborative endeavors in mobile residencies. I enjoy combining my academic background and intellectual capacities with the practicalities of everyday living – to take part in the communal exchange of experience and idea based activities.,My creative/intellectual practice is in constant oscillation between spaces of extensive collaboration and focused individual isolation. Collaboration allows me to explore and expand my practice beyond its natural scope. As an artist and thinker_COMMA_ I recognize my intellectual and physical limitations and in doing so actively seek others to help me develop new methods of information creation. Within a collaborative exchange_COMMA_ I find ways to immerse myself in environments (be it urban or rural) that would be otherwise entirely foreign to me._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_My interests lie in collaboration as a means of emergence – allowing group dynamics within a variety of settings to inform_COMMA_ transform and guide my practice and that of others. I believe in cohabitation as a means of furthering knowledge in a project_COMMA_ of letting time unfurl as dynamic practice-based encounters reveal new patterns in the bodies and minds of each collaborator. I am interested in the idea of community building in order to transport the encounters beyond their initial framework. My process is about sharing – creating rhyzomatic matrixes of connections and experiences with other bodies in space. In order to do so_COMMA_ I open up my projects to the greater public_COMMA_ inviting them to contribute_COMMA_ challenge_COMMA_ and transform its course according to their own life experience. I enter every project in anticipation that it will somehow_COMMA_ at some point_COMMA_ leave my hands to become molded by the minds of others._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I must also acknowledge that there are times when the collaborative act becomes one of tension in my work. In these times_COMMA_ when ideas collide and actions oppose_COMMA_ I find myself to be the most amazed at what can emerge from individuals not meshing. The balance between my own practice and others begins to blur in these instances_COMMA_ and so we begin an important process of negotiation and communication.,In SHUTTLE (Summer 2013) I joined a group of international artists_COMMA_ designers_COMMA_ performance makers and researchers in a journey through the deserts of the American south-west performing an exploration of the aesthetic_COMMA_ political_COMMA_ cultural and environmental resonances of desert ecologies. As a temporary travelling community_COMMA_ our interests were in movement_COMMA_ environment_COMMA_ and performance. Our work consisted of generating new creative practices and works that shuttled between registers of the known and unknown by exploring performances of mobility. Journeying through seminal land arts works_COMMA_ ancient settlements_COMMA_ desert conditions_COMMA_ and spaces of transit_COMMA_ we performed daily actions creating ephemeral conditions and generating encounters. Our experience took us through an initial and closing event in Tucson_COMMA_ Arizona_COMMA_ and a five-day performance at Performance Studies International (Psi 19) conference at Stanford University in Paolo Alto. We travelled close to four thousand miles from Tucson and back in a white Chevrolet van moving through the Sonoran_COMMA_ Great Basin and Mojave Deserts._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_SHUTTLE explored notions of creative and everyday cohabitation that have prepared and made me seek out more collaborative laboratories that allow for an intense and condensed period of exchange to occur. The constant process of negotiation between each individual of the group_COMMA_ the attempts and desire to fulfill both collective and personal goals_COMMA_ as well as the commitment to each other to hold a communal practice shared by all made for an intense environment of mobile performance and dialogue. The final product of the project was part collaborative and part individual. However_COMMA_ a clear overlap and strong influence occurred between the participants pushing the boundaries of each other’s work in different directions.,During the summer of 2013_COMMA_ I spent two months at Nes Artist Residency in Skagastrond_COMMA_ Iceland. During this time_COMMA_ I shared a family-sized home with three people. Spending most of our days in this space_COMMA_ our group developed a strong relationship with each other that manifested itself through cooking_COMMA_ eating_COMMA_ working_COMMA_ and playing together. Each night of the week a different member of the household cooked a meal_COMMA_ with the rest of the group contributing to its preparation. We used this time to exchange ideas about work and more importantly to discover things about the other people. In the evening_COMMA_ we often played games_COMMA_ usually suggested and organized by a different person each night. These served not only to strengthen our bond as a group of artists living together_COMMA_ but also contributed to the works being created during the daytime. We also began exploring notions of collaboration together. Although nothing complete transpired_COMMA_ our exchanges provided fertile ground for creative stimulation._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_In SHUTTLE_COMMA_ every aspect of the trip revolved around communal living. The group slowly began to work as a well-oiled machine as tasks and responsibilities became divided within the group. Many have remarked since the end of the trip that the act of everyday living (communally) was the very essence of the collaboration.,My interest in applying to the hike this summer stems from a desire to return and continue exploring notions of mobile collaboration and performance within a natural setting. As a city dweller_COMMA_ I find it necessary to regain contact with nature whenever I can. This challenges my practice and thinking to move out of its habitual relationship to the spatial structure of the urban context and to adapt itself to a different setting. My daily practice often relies on the concrete structures that I dwell and evolve in. These formations become points for me to anchor my physical actions and critical thinking. Outside of the city_COMMA_ living of a packsack and subjected to the power of nature_COMMA_ I develop new and different perspectives and physical actions that would not manifest themselves otherwise. My hope is to break with the monotonous and cyclical behaviour of urban living by immersing myself in a natural context where thinking and doing manifest themselves differently and out of necessity._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I am also hoping that the hike_COMMA_ in its collaborative and cohabitation structure_COMMA_ will aid in developing my individual practice and give way to a collective bond. My desire is to take part in a community experience that will expand beyond the session – to make contacts and relationships that will begin to inform further exchanges. As an artist who works through a critical embodiment of space and place my work will inevitably become shaped by the minds and anatomies of those who will participate in the hike. Hopefully_COMMA_ I can bring others into my process and lend myself to theirs in order to develop a dialogue._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The hike_COMMA_ in its relationship to the Central Catskills offers a chance to explore a geographical region that I have grown up driving through and had little firsthand contact with. My hope is to engage the region as a thinker_COMMA_ creator_COMMA_ and human being in order to become more knowledgeable about its ecological structure and habitat.,The workshop I would most likely want to lead during the hike revolves around a series of actions that I have recently developed with an at-risk high school youth group. The workshops reflect on notions of collective walks as spaces of potential insurrection and change. In their current form_COMMA_ they combine immersive lectures and workshops_COMMA_ drawing from art history_COMMA_ popular culture_COMMA_ an embodied practice_COMMA_ and notions of play._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The proposed work involves bringing members of the hike together with a one-meter rope. A direct reference to Linda Montano and Tehching Hsieh’s One Year Performance 1983-1984 (Rope Piece) where the two artists tied themselves with a one-meter rope for an entire year. The workshop explores the physical and psychological manifestation of ‘being tied or roped’ together. What emerges is an interesting collective effort as individuals negotiate being bound together and fulfilling certain tasks/needs in their immediate environment. The workshop would also include a lecture portion where historical precedents for this type of bondage is exhibited_COMMA_ therefore furthering the intellectual exercise of understanding the act being performed. I would anticipate beginning the workshop with groups of two being bound_COMMA_ and slowly work our way until the whole group is tied together thus forming a collective body. The performative actions and thinking that would develop would inevitably be linked to the natural environment we evolve in. The workshop would take this setting into consideration and adapt to the space in order to connect gestures and actions back to the site.,,How does it feel to ascribe to a ‘global’ art system? A striking issue in applying for international residencies is that the mode of life that has developed around them is one of privilege. The 21st century ‘mobility’ of the artist figure is an issue that I am interested in_COMMA_ and struggle with regularly. As a Canadian and son of two professionals_COMMA_ I am aware that the movement I follow is in great part a product of my socio-economic standing rather than a sign of a ‘true’ democratic global art system whereby artists can travel freely and participate in residencies. It is this sense of unease in mobility that brings me to ground myself_COMMA_ to look for self-aware communities of artists who recognize their local environment and respect it.,None,Residency Unlimited,Meat (I do eat fish).

While I hate the way that sounds_COMMA_ I like the way it looks. By both honoring and critiquing work of this nature_COMMA_ I make comments on the tradition of “Sunday Afternoon Painters”. My subject matter can be read as sentimental_COMMA_ but I see it as a recording of time. The sun is setting_COMMA_ the moon is moving_COMMA_ and the flowers are dying. How one brush stroke leads to the next is more important to me that the subject matter—the subject matter is just the vehicle to get me from point A to point B. For me_COMMA_ it all comes back to paint on paper. In a current series of paintings_COMMA_ the circle in the form of the moon_COMMA_ sun_COMMA_ streetlights_COMMA_ and balloons formally ties the work together. My work involves a vigorous studio practice_COMMA_ painting everyday. At times_COMMA_ I paint outdoors in plein air on hikes and back packing trips. At night_COMMA_ I paint in my car utilizing my moon roof to capture the night sky. I am trying to reach nature from an unnatural place. My work is a recording of the suburban landscape. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_On a less formal note_COMMA_ I am a navy brat who has lived in more houses than years I have been alive. I have a one-eyed dog and two cats. Currently_COMMA_ I am finishing up my last semester of grad school in sunny and humid Tampa_COMMA_ Florida_COMMA_ looking ahead to the next adventure.,While I still love the romanticized vision of the artist alone in their studio_COMMA_ for me_COMMA_ it’s not a realistic one. My creative practice is collaborative mostly in the sense that I depend on an audience for critique and feedback on an idea or a body of work in progress. I find discussing the ends and outs of particular idea helpful for my own process. In order for my work to be effective I want to find out what is working both visually and conceptually. A collaborative audience provides that valuable feedback to aid in making my creative process stronger. Having been in graduate school for the past three years_COMMA_ I have received this collaboration though the institution of academia. Now that I am leaving academia_COMMA_ I want to search out this richness in conversation from new sources. In addition_COMMA_ I also collaborate within an artist collective called EyeSplice_COMMA_ featuring twelve artists around the country and South America. Together we have formed a network to exhibit together_COMMA_ provide critiques_COMMA_ and work on our professional development. We have upcoming shows in Long Island City_COMMA_ NY and Tampa_COMMA_ FL. Working with this group provides me with support and accountability. We hold each other up to certain standards and look out for opportunities that would benefit one another or the whole group. Again_COMMA_ while the lone artist may be a romantic vision_COMMA_ it’s an impractical one. As artists/thinkers supporting one another leads to richer work and lives.,http://www.briananicolephelps.com/paintings/,While most nights were not spent sleeping there_COMMA_ I feel my graduate school studio provided one of my many communal living experiences. When you’re spending an average of eight or more hours a day in a shared space_COMMA_ it becomes a community_COMMA_ or at least it should. Luckily for me_COMMA_ my experience led to a wonderful exchange of ideas_COMMA_ supplies and support. When I needed advice_COMMA_ someone was usually there to take a look at a piece or bounce an idea off of. When I ran out of something_COMMA_ there was a chance someone had some more. Most importantly_COMMA_ in the moments I doubted myself_COMMA_ one of my colleagues provided with me with support to keep me going. I was also there to provide the same for my studio mates. While the studio wasn’t my actual home_COMMA_ the sense of community there made it feel like one.,The theme of this course is what first brought me to apply to The School of Making Thinking. Recently_COMMA_ I had a discussion with my mentor and professor Elisabeth Condon about my work’s approach to the natural through the unnatural. Like the Tonalist before me_COMMA_ my work is in part a reaction to the industrialization and suburbanization of the natural world. In a way_COMMA_ my work is a survey of the suburban landscape. Part of my reasoning for painting outdoors in natural spaces allows me an attempt at connecting with the natural world and recording this attempt with paint on paper. However_COMMA_ unlike the Tonalist_COMMA_ there is an unnatural quality to my work_COMMA_ too far removed from the natural state. This is why I am interested in exploring whether or not it’s possible to reconnect with The Wild.,,I would like to remain as open as possible at this point in order to fully benefit from the experience of the residency_COMMA_ although I can confidently envision painting as the main aspect of the project. I believe being able to explore the area_COMMA_ as you state—socially_COMMA_ intellectually_COMMA_ and environmentally will inspire new work much in the same way that Florida has. I imagine spending a lot of time outdoors painting and pondering.,What the best thing you’ve ever won?_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_When I was in the sixth grade_COMMA_ we lived in Hawaii in military housing. I went to a dance at the recreation center and bought a raffle ticket. I won a ride on a submarine—that was yellow!

I'm very passionate about experimental narrative filmmaking and I think about it all the time. In my day to day life_COMMA_ I live in Brooklyn and I'm playing it by ear. I write a lot: mostly absurd/surreal narratives. I spend a lot of time working on films and music videos_COMMA_ and also helping friends make their own things. I like comedy and laughing and making people laugh. I'm also really interested in experimental comedy_COMMA_ especially irony - and maybe also kind of shock humor and vulgarity as they related to absurdity? I don't know.,Is it okay if I'm not sure? I like to have conversations and talks with other people about art and philosophy_COMMA_ because I just find it really stimulating. I'm very interested in acting and improvisation and empathy_COMMA_ both creatively and personally.

I am fascinated by an artistic practice that seeks zen moments of creativity_COMMA_ in which artistic will is able to flow free and unobstructed. And I guess the flip side of the coin is that when I'm not actively creating_COMMA_ I spend a lot of time thinking_COMMA_ mulling things over_COMMA_ self-analyzing.,,I am interested in experimenting with an artistic process that merges writing and creating with personal ritual and spirituality. I'd like to structure my days of writing with rituals like meditation and physical movement interspersed throughout_COMMA_ and make the conscious choice to engage with these rituals spiritually and existentially. I am curious about how that will affect my writing and my experience of writing and my experience of living - especially because in urban NYC I feel like I rarely engage with any spirituality or personal ritual. I'd maybe even hope to stage scenes from this writing with other people at SMT to feel out how they work_COMMA_ and whether a ritualistic writing process might yield a different performance process for an actor/collaborator.,WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW? I'm standing at this standing desk I made by placing a box that used to hold a vacuum cleaner on top of my regular desk in my room. I'm re-reading this application and nitpicking my responses to the questions.

I don’t want to unlearn what I learned in school_COMMA_ because much of it was valuable to my intellectual development and creative practice. Rather_COMMA_ I’m trying to re-inhabit the state of inhibition that I remember occupying before all of the high concept and theory. In my ideal state_COMMA_ I’m able to create in a way that is unencumbered and fluid_COMMA_ and my creative mind is in constant dialogue (verging on unified) with my critical mind. Much of what I internalized about artistic discipline through higher education has formed an obstacle to the act of creation. Bit by bit_COMMA_ I am disintegrating that obstacle and allowing myself to play_COMMA_ enjoy not knowing_COMMA_ and let go of outcome expectations._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_In order to achieve equilibrium_COMMA_ the next big step in my life is to find the right physical place and space to occupy and call home. This is essential. At the moment_COMMA_ I feel like I’m drifting through the sea_COMMA_ not in a huge hurry_COMMA_ not exactly sure where I’m headed_COMMA_ only certain that I’m going wash up onto the shore somewhere new. Over the past few years I’ve split my time between the Bay Area of California and the Research Triangle of North Carolina. In a couple of days_COMMA_ I depart for Iceland for a two-month residency in Reykjavík. When I return_COMMA_ the next move I make will be to my new home_COMMA_ and I’m excited about that. I just need to figure out where it will be. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Rather than a biographic summary_COMMA_ this is me now_COMMA_ putting one foot in front of the other until I arrive.,Conceptually_COMMA_ I consider all creative and intellectual work to be collaborative. Whether drawing_COMMA_ performing live_COMMA_ or writing a research paper_COMMA_ each expression is influenced and by all of the things I have learned_COMMA_ read_COMMA_ seen_COMMA_ heard_COMMA_ discussed_COMMA_ felt_COMMA_ and understood prior to the moment of expression. Any artist is in a collaborative relationship with the world around them at all times_COMMA_ and this relationship includes current events_COMMA_ media_COMMA_ trends in art_COMMA_ peers_COMMA_ creative partners_COMMA_ professional expectations_COMMA_ financial obligations_COMMA_ available materials_COMMA_ available work space_COMMA_ etc. Not only are the ideas that I have a result of my collaboration with the world around me_COMMA_ but the way my ideas manifest (and even which ideas I am able to manifest) depends greatly on who I am_COMMA_ what I have to work with_COMMA_ where I am_COMMA_ and when I’m doing it. I depend on collaboration at every moment. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Actually_COMMA_ I collaborate with many peer artists. I view my network of fellow creatives as a resource for mutual support and growth. Since 2009_COMMA_ I have been working with a group called The Performance Collective_COMMA_ which I helped found in Chapel Hill_COMMA_ NC during my time as an undergraduate. Our work is original_COMMA_ devised_COMMA_ experimental performance_COMMA_ which we develop through a process of ideation based on sharing_COMMA_ exchange_COMMA_ and improvisation. It is in this process that I developed not only the capacity to work with other artists_COMMA_ but the ability drop my focus on authorship_COMMA_ say yes_COMMA_ and co-create. This experience has undoubtedly been a benefit across the board in my life. Besides TPC_COMMA_ I have done collaborative projects_COMMA_ from building renovations to essays_COMMA_ with many groups_COMMA_ including Rock Paper Scissors Collective (Oakland)_COMMA_ Signify Sanctify Believe! (LA)_COMMA_ the Xhurch (Portland)_COMMA_ Girltown (multi-city)_COMMA_ The Queer Explorer’s Club (NYC / Greensboro_COMMA_ NC)_COMMA_ Queerlab (Greensboro_COMMA_ NC) and Elsewhere (Greensboro_COMMA_ NC).,The 2012/2013 project I created with The Performance Collective members Brian Hicks and Larissa Kaul called “(YOU YOURSELF WE WE ARE ARE WE) EVEN HERE <?” was all about asking and answering questions related to gender_COMMA_ identity_COMMA_ and performance. We began with a set of questions about queerness and art and knew we wanted to turn the exploration of these questions into a performance. Over the course of three months_COMMA_ we did writing exercises_COMMA_ improvisational movement research_COMMA_ had many discussions_COMMA_ and turned our thoughts into images_COMMA_ sequences_COMMA_ and eventually a show. Not every project I do takes the form of an hour-long performance_COMMA_ but the process tends to be similar_COMMA_ starting with questions and using whatever media I am focusing on to express my thoughts_COMMA_ answers_COMMA_ and sometimes even the questions themselves. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I like to make art that is political_COMMA_ but not polemical. I imagine that the best thing a piece of (political) art can do is confuse someone who thinks they already know the answer. Art can / should ask questions and start / participate in conversations. I try to use creative processes and critical research processes interchangeably_COMMA_ so that art projects become an educational experiment. Each project is ultimately about learning something or at least understanding it better than when I started. I believe that this approach is very much in line with SMT’s pursuit to_COMMA_ “expand traditional notion[s] of thinking.” Academia encourages you to have a thesis that you can support with other people’s previous work or a hypothesis that you seek to prove. This approach can be valuable_COMMA_ but when you’re looking for something specific_COMMA_ you’re likely to miss other things that are there. The practice I have described is more of an attempt to travel through questions without a destination in mind.,As an undergraduate_COMMA_ I was part of a co-ed literary and arts society called St. Anthony Hall. We had a house_COMMA_ which was a residence for (give or take) seven people_COMMA_ but a part-time home for anywhere between twenty and thirty. I lived there for a little over two years. Luckily_COMMA_ it was an overall positive experience_COMMA_ but it was full of challenges_COMMA_ compromises_COMMA_ and lessons. In addition to simply sharing space_COMMA_ we coordinated regular chapter meals_COMMA_ shared cleaning responsibilities_COMMA_ and undertook projects on campus and in the community together. In hindsight_COMMA_ I’m always proud of how well we organized it all_COMMA_ even if it was chaotic on the surface. As a member of The Hall (as we called it) I learned that clear communication and a constructive_COMMA_ cooperative attitude are essential to the mental health of everyone involved. I have numerous friends who have had negative communal living experiences_COMMA_ both in coops and normal multi-roommate houses. In all of these situations a lack of communication and/or bad attitudes were the culprit(s). We had some rough times at The Hall_COMMA_ but we did a great job of trusting and supporting each other while identifying the problems and dealing with them.,I’m drawn to “Unthinking / Unknowing” because_COMMA_ as I began to explain in my “About Me” section_COMMA_ I am currently in the process of undoing certain aspects of my higher education training in an attempt to re-learn ways I was working creatively before then. The idea that_COMMA_ “Thinking is always something that happens when we are least prepared_COMMA_ unexpecting_COMMA_ unknowing_COMMA_” resonates with me deeply. This is something that I do my best to lean into in my artistic practice. The content of this session is related to conceptual interests of mine (especially Deleuze and also the work of Paolo Friere) and will use methods I am comfortable with and greatly enjoy (especially physical and meditation practices). I am excited about the combination of physical_COMMA_ textual_COMMA_ and internal approaches described in the session information_COMMA_ because it seems to parallel the type of process that I have undertaken in the development of prior work_COMMA_ especially performance. This is a unique opportunity to engage in this type of process with a group of completely new people and without the purpose of creating a performance at the end of it all. What else could come out of this work? I am eager to find out! As I said in the above section_COMMA_ when we are looking for a specific outcome_COMMA_ we miss other possibilities. In lieu of working towards a performance_COMMA_ there is great potential for something I have not even imagined to manifest_COMMA_ which is very exciting to me. Finally_COMMA_ from what I have read about SMT_COMMA_ the exchange between / among “teachers” and “students” seems to be much more symbiotic than in a traditional learning environment. I feel like this is a session that I will not only benefit from attending_COMMA_ but to which I will be able to make meaningful contribution.,I am not applying to the Hike.,At SMT I would challenge myself to do something outside of_COMMA_ or at least not primarily focused in_COMMA_ my normal repertoire_COMMA_ which would be some sort of devised or improvised performance_COMMA_ probably involving a video or other visual art element. I’ve been leaning toward the medium of sound lately_COMMA_ and that is a skill set I want to develop further. Given unlimited funding_COMMA_ I’d invest in recording tools and production equipment_COMMA_ and focus my energies to this end. In keeping with SMT's encouragement of intermedia projects_COMMA_ I’d seek ways to activate and incorporate a variety of media and creative / critical strategies. I've recently been very interested in how contemporary technology_COMMA_ such as mobile devices - laptops_COMMA_ cell phones_COMMA_ tablets_COMMA_ etc. - and the Internet can be used in live performance_COMMA_ activated for audience participation_COMMA_ etc. These tools that we interact with constantly are primarily used for information_COMMA_ but I want to explore the potential of their non-intended uses_COMMA_ especially as sonic instruments. This relates to the session to which I'm applying in that engaging with technologies in this way requires a certain amount of purposeful forgetting / unknowing the assumed rules and boundaries of these tools.,"What is your aspiration in life? Like Beyoncé says in ""Pretty Hurts_COMMA_"" my aspiration in life is to be happy_COMMA_ but what does that look like? For me_COMMA_ a young artist doing my best to carve out a sustaining creative career_COMMA_ happiness looks like being debt-free_COMMA_ having a place (maybe separate places) where I can comfortably work and live_COMMA_ being able to support myself and the people I love with my work_COMMA_ and doing work that not only pays the bills but that is constructive_COMMA_ innovative_COMMA_ and inspirational to as many people as possible.",I have no current plans for the months of May-July.,Elsewhere_COMMA_ Etc.

Spent time in the Midwest for School (undergraduate studies at Oberlin in Ohio_COMMA_ graduate studies at The Art Institute of Chicago. For the year and a half I have lived and work in Brooklyn. I am a video and performance artist. I work in time based mediums and am very interested in time as a medium-- slow time_COMMA_ collapsed time_COMMA_ repeating time. I also work as a teaching artist in New York. This practice is very important to me as well_COMMA_ spending time teaching art in New York City public schools feeds my artistic practice and vice versa. I like to teach_COMMA_ talk_COMMA_ dance_COMMA_ eat and make art.,In my creative practice I often use 'participants' to generate material that is then used in my video projects. I create structures in which 'participants' can contribute thoughts_COMMA_ words_COMMA_ perspectives etc. I consider these 'participants' collaborators in some way. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Example of such a project can be seen here: _NEWLINE_https://vimeo.com/25423335_NEWLINE__NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I also have worked on a number of more traditionally collaborative projects with fellow artists. Below are some examples: _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_http://gplusgcollective.com/statement_NEWLINE_https://vimeo.com/57159845_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Over and over again I turn to my external world and the people in it (both friends and strangers) to aid me in my creative process. Between reading groups_COMMA_ traditional and less traditional modes of collaboration_COMMA_ I feel that the people around me are constantly influencing my practice_COMMA_ process and perception.,Below is a link to a video project entitled_COMMA_ Dedication to this View. It is a 45-minute video that pieces together original and found footage to create a long_COMMA_ meditative work addressing themes of distance_COMMA_ concealment_COMMA_ sexuality and the act of viewing. Though theme was clear when I began the project_COMMA_ the process of taking and then editing the footage organic and highly institutive. This way of making is very different from other projects of mine that use structure and constraints in their process. The majority of the material was shot with an iPhone_COMMA_ at times entering into the realm of the diaristic and banal_COMMA_ producing a video that acknowledges the tool of its production. The video builds through a process of compilation and in its careful attention to rhythm and pattern_COMMA_ and attempts to push the banality of living in the world until its strangeness is exposed. The informal performances and occurrences of day-to-day life that are chronicled in the video are abutted by altered footage from historical film and performance art. Dedication of this View acts as representation of_COMMA_ and meditation on_COMMA_ the intersection between these considerations. As the video weaves together a series of sources_COMMA_ the subjectivity of the artist/performer/editor emerges as the constant and is continually projected into the frame of both original and found footage. This video and the process I engaged to produce it felt to me to be a process of unthinking_COMMA_ of allowing my daily life to bleed into my artistic life and vice versa. I was interested in breaking down and challenging the way I was ‘knowing’ and approaching my artistic practice while in graduate school. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_An excerpt: https://vimeo.com/52748764_NEWLINE_Full video (40 min long): https://vimeo.com/60756183,My most recent communal living experience was last year. I spent a month at a residency in Italy. I shared a room with three other women and shared a kitchen and living space with 16 international residents. We made did communal grocery shops and made communal meals. We spent our days working together on a publication that was put out by Mousse Publishing. The residency was particular in that we were not only living communally but we were also collaborating together throughout the month.,I am very interested in the idea of unthinking/unknowning. After my time in graduate school (I graduated Spring 2011) I have spent a lot of time attempting to 'unknow' some of what I was taught or exposed to during the two intense years. I felt in many ways that my practice during school became too ridged and didactic. I believe an artistic_COMMA_ intellectual_COMMA_ creative practice thrives when there is a balance between critical rigorous inquiry and open ended process based play or discovery. Recently I have been spending some time at an Ashram upstate and beginning a mediation practice.

I spent the previous year as an Arts Fellow at The Drisha Institute of Jewish Education studying Torah with a creative focus on death_COMMA_ destruction_COMMA_ and resurrection in the Talmud. I received my BA from the University of Chicago in 2012_COMMA_ where I studied the intersection of aesthetics and ethics through literature and the visual arts. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_My artistic practice stems from a fundamental fascination with the permeability of bodily borders. I investigate the ways in which we experience and process our physicality and materiality in the face of what lies beyond our bodies and our lived experience. I am heavily influenced by the texts and practices of various religious and spiritual doctrines_COMMA_ as well as literature and philosophy that addresses death_COMMA_ aesthetics_COMMA_ faith_COMMA_ emotion_COMMA_ and ethics. Profound attention to the written word_COMMA_ as well as texture_COMMA_ movement_COMMA_ and space_COMMA_ is the foundation for constructing multi-disciplinary art experiences that audience members can access through various layers of consciousness. My work is meant to bring viewers into confrontation with the limits of being in order to recognize the inherent beauty of what lies on either side_COMMA_ in order to transcend fear and liberate pain. I seek to temper the morbid and the grotesque with a reverence for details_COMMA_ to infuse the shadows with grace.,I am very attached to conversation as a tool for processing any stage of creation_COMMA_ from idea generating to logistics. This allows me to clarify concepts and refine details. Whether or not I am collaborating with another person in the traditional sense of sharing authorship_COMMA_ I rely on conversation and consider it a collaborative practice._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Currently_COMMA_ I am collaborating on an experimental film adaptation of a Kafka short story with my brother_COMMA_ an NYC based filmmaker. We began by closely reading the text and building off of each other's interpretations until we aligned our vision of the text. We used these thoughts as a foundation for the screenplay_COMMA_ which we debated at length. Now_COMMA_ we are in the midst of story-boarding the screenplay; we discuss what is contained in each image and its significance_COMMA_ how this moment should affect the viewer_COMMA_ and how we can best frame the moment to achieve this. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Last spring_COMMA_ I co-choreographed a performance piece based on the tahara_COMMA_ the Jewish ritual washing of the dead. The two of us usually focused our energies on different aspects of the work: I was more concerned with the conceptual framework_COMMA_ while my partner was more interested in specific movements and transitions. Much of the work consisted of us moving around in a room together_COMMA_ testing our ideas_COMMA_ and discovering what we both liked. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I am eager_COMMA_ always_COMMA_ to experience new collaborative structures.,"This is an installation I mounted in June as part the Drisha Institute's Artist Showcase: _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ehkbpqievzr8n3g/2hdsn1K-DV_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Ani Hashem Rofecha: A Cabinet of Curiosity _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The Cabinet of Curiosity_COMMA_ also known as a Cabinet of Wonder_COMMA_ or a Wonder-room_COMMA_ was an encyclopedic collection of objects whose categorical boundaries were as yet undefined. A precursor to the museum_COMMA_ this European Renaissance form was likened to a ""theater of the world"" and conveyed a certain control of the world. The attempt to classify the unclassified_COMMA_ to possess the elusive_COMMA_ created the illusion that profound knowledge had been grasped. While these cabinets are impressive_COMMA_ their contents spark more questions than answers. Indeed_COMMA_ the Cabinet of Curiosity conveys an attempt to know_COMMA_ and the impossibility of doing so. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Drawing from Chapter 11 of Tractate Sanhedrin of the Babylonian Talmud_COMMA_ I have created and curated a Curiosity Cabinet of objects and ideas.

The Cabinet of Curiosity doubles as a medicinal cabinet for a body that is entirely decontextualized_COMMA_ wherein bone and viscera encounter the destroying_COMMA_ resurrecting_COMMA_ redeeming_COMMA_ healing God before we do.",Among the many communal living experiences I've had_COMMA_ the most colorful was the month I spent in Tsfat_COMMA_ in the very north of Israel_COMMA_ in an all women's seminary for the study of ultra-orthodox mystical Judaism. The expectations of this community were beyond anything I could've imagined: we were to keep our knees_COMMA_ elbows_COMMA_ and collar bones covered; we were to pray_COMMA_ as best as we could_COMMA_ three times a day; and we were discouraged from interacting with men_COMMA_ should the rare opportunity present itself. I was more aware of my collar bones than I had ever been in my life_COMMA_ developed an intense fondness for the utility of scarves_COMMA_ and sang out loud despite the rebuke of our male security guard. I learned deeply how far I could stretch myself for the sake of community and how far I was willing to go. Despite the everyday frustrations of my short visit to this world_COMMA_ I forged profound connections with my seminary mates_COMMA_ whether through contemplating the nature of God or laughing at ourselves before bed.,The very idea that thinking is a creative act spurs my artistic practice. I am very drawn to a critical approach_COMMA_ and have struggled with the idea that critical analysis can be understood as_COMMA_ by nature_COMMA_ deconstructive. The act of analysis_COMMA_ however_COMMA_ is an attempt at constructing meaning_COMMA_ which is a profoundly creative act. I would like to continue to explore this tension_COMMA_ which informs the core of my artistic practice. The course on Unthinking/Unknowing would be a perfect place to do so._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I am extremely interested in the limits of the body_COMMA_ and this fixation is coupled with the less urgent but ever powerful fascination with the limits of the mind. I am interested in exploring this through conceptually and experientially. In the work I create_COMMA_ I seek to draw attention to line between the known and the unknown_COMMA_ between this world and the next. Exploring this liminal space through thought and experience strikes me as particularly important_COMMA_ so that I might gain insight into how to bring audience attention to processing this liminal space when I create my own work. The course on Unthinking/Unknowing addresses my key interests through an innovative and multivalent approach_COMMA_ which appeals intensely to me. I work in a multi-disciplinary fashion in order to access the wisdom of articulated and unarticulated thought and emotion. This course would illuminate these access points and deepen my practice substantially.,,I would like to mount an interactive installation that investigates death_COMMA_ memory_COMMA_ and loss. The space would resemble a bedroom and be laden with objects and clues about who once inhabited the space. These three options would be valid: a. the room belonged to a deceased person; b. the room belongs to someone who may or may not be deceased_COMMA_ and who is speaking through the objects; c. the viewer is the deceased. The inclusion of relational objects would be an important aspect of the project_COMMA_ as well as the participation of one viewer at a time. The objects_COMMA_ as well as the space itself_COMMA_ would slip between the extremely mundane_COMMA_ the abject_COMMA_ and the surreal_COMMA_ thus sliding between an awareness of the body_COMMA_ at its most visceral_COMMA_ and the psyche_COMMA_ at its most detached. I would be keen on experimenting with how to blur the line between the felt and the seen; the sense of the living and the sense of the dead.

I'm in the process of transitioning toward full time music/audio work._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_As an artist/musician_COMMA_ I'm interested in the creative possiblities offered by manipulating sampled audio. The music I produce with samples ranges from basic hip-hop beats (""ripping off"" for bars and slapping some drums on it) to more involved productions composed of many tiny samples from various sources. Sampling is often derided as simple stealing_COMMA_ but I think producers like J Dilla_COMMA_ Madlib_COMMA_ the Avalanches_COMMA_ et al. clearly create artistic value with the choices they make. I aim to make music that brings the relationship between sampler and samplee to the forefront._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_On a related note_COMMA_ I've also started writing about the effect that the interfaces of electronic music equipment have upon the music created with them. My current focus is on some of the classic samplers (MPC_COMMA_ SP-1200) used to make iconic hip-hop and house records. The UI of gear almost inevitably leads to specific musical choices_COMMA_ but I haven't seen these choices discussed outside of informal conversations with other electronic music producers._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I'm also interested in interactive music projects I'm currently developing a project tentatively titled Crowd Raps. I set up a phone line that_COMMA_ when you call in_COMMA_ plays a hip-hop instrumental. The caller is encouraged to rap or sing along to the beat_COMMA_ and anything they do is recorded to a server.

In this situation_COMMA_ the callers are reacting to music and creating something of their own_COMMA_ but they don't know how their own contribution will exist as part of the final work._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I'd also argue that in performing live as an electronic dance musician_COMMA_ the relationship between performer and dancers - traditionally viewed as performer/audience - can in fact be collaborative. I've been in situations where the music I played was directly influenced by activity on the dance floor._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_All of that said_COMMA_ much of my work is produced entirely on my own. I'm interested in the School of Making Thing precisely because I want to open up my creative process to collaboration!","I've recently been releasing music under the name Ink Jet. Last summer_COMMA_ I put out my first record_COMMA_ Grandma Tapes._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The music on Grandma Tapes was composed with a set of strict rules: 1) Every sound on the record was sampled from a box of cassette tapes my grandmother left for me when she died. 2) Each track was created from samples of a single work by a (generally Romantic classical) composer. 3) I used a single hardware sampler to create the record; I wanted to stay away from working in the visual environment a computer offers._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_These rules helped direct me through a creative process that examined the musical taste of a past generation while generating music that sounded vastly different. The experience of listening to the tapes was very emotional for me; I listened to them imagining how my grandmother had. It was also a way to deeply explore the technique of sampling; I learned to doing things like coax a dance-style kick drum out of a symphony._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Currently_COMMA_ I'm working on a series of musical sketches as part of a weekly project I call Natural Athleticism. Every Wednesday in 2014_COMMA_ I'm releasing a new track online. Each one is based on a rough idea from a list I've drawn up: e.g._COMMA_ ""make music claps that slowly grow into applause_COMMA_ then return to rhythmic clapping"". Natural Athleticism is a way to keep myself working through specific ideas that interest me_COMMA_ rather than simply ""writing songs""._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Both of these projects are linked above.",I spent my first two years in New York living with a group of other musicians. This wasn't an organized communal living experience so much as simply living with roommates_COMMA_ but it had a great effect on the art I created. Specifically_COMMA_ my proximity to people with different taste got me involved in styles/genres that I had previously never even tried to understand. E.g._COMMA_ I used to think that most four-to-the-floor dance music was too rhythmically simple to pay attention to; now I make some myself. Long story short_COMMA_ my experience of living with others was one of opening up my mind to different forms of expression._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Another thing that's important to me: communal food.

Then_COMMA_ I felt a pressure welling up inside of me. I walked out into the light_COMMA_ raised my little head up to the sky_COMMA_ and roared with my full body and soul_COMMA_ howled at the sun. Then I woke up._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I bring this up because the dream put me in touch with a sort wellspring of primal_COMMA_ weird energy within me that I had been ignoring or suppressing. And in the years since_COMMA_ I have failed to harness whatever powerful experience I had in that dream_COMMA_ though I've thought about it a lot. I realize that this might come across as absurd_COMMA_ but I hope that the Nature/Culture session might give me a helpful lens to address this topic of untapped wildness in myself._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I'm also intrigued by the subject of Unthinking/Unknowing. I'm always looking for situations that bring about creative thought_COMMA_ from running to meditation to substances to a shower. My current method of making art treats creative thought like work_COMMA_ providing a steady framework in which to let the mind free. I hope that this session would open me to a broader set of exercises that might change the way I think.",N/A,"Given unlimited funding_COMMA_ I would love to mount a massive sound installation on a chunk of woodland.

2/28/2014 15:47:26,Jaime,Knight,jaimecknight@gmail.com,414-260-6802,jaimecknight,USA,Iowa City,6/22/1972,www.jaimecknight.com,http://www.jaimecknight.com/resume/,Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING),I’m applying in collaboration with Ari Marcantonio. I’m currently finishing up my MFA at the University of Iowa. I gave up a tenured job teaching art to high school students to return to school. While most people get their MFA so they can teach_COMMA_ I did the opposite. I love academia_COMMA_ and spent the three years prior to becoming a high school teacher getting an MA in Art Education_COMMA_ but am excited to be finished with it for a while. Due to the dearth of queer studies at the university I’m at_COMMA_ I’ve become a bit of an autodidact in the field_COMMA_ which relates to my work_COMMA_ where I address issues/ideas around the development of queer subjectivity. For many years I lived in the San Francisco Bay Area where_COMMA_ prior to teaching (and a bit less while living a professional lifestyle)_COMMA_ I played in bands and had an amazing house in the Mission where I hosted tons of pop shows. Because of that_COMMA_ I’ve been able to travel extensively_COMMA_ which is something I love. I recently met and talked to Yvonne Ranier_COMMA_ who I really connected with when I told her I studied classical ballet for nine years_COMMA_ and was excited to talk with her about bringing my past as a performer into my current visual-art practice. Which is something I’ve been trying to do and thinking a lot about. I’m trying to commit entirely to my creative practice. While most of my colleagues are applying for jobs_COMMA_ I’m applying to residencies. This commitment is scary_COMMA_ because it means no income_COMMA_ transience and precarity. There is a part of me who just wants house-plants and a cat_COMMA_ but I feel like now is the time to throw caution to the wind and see what happens. I’m excited!,I guess one theme of my life_COMMA_ whether it’s been having shows at my house or teaching in the classroom_COMMA_ has been community building. This is important to me because I believe that we only truly begin to know ourselves through our encounter with others. While the majority of my creative practice has been a kind of traditional_COMMA_ studio based one_COMMA_ I’ve always imagined it to be based in communication and just one tool through which to experience that encounter. Lately though_COMMA_ I’ve been expanding what it means to create work that is in communication with the viewer and make work that actually requires the viewer to participate in order to be complete. I’m trying to collaborate with my viewer not just in the creation of meaning_COMMA_ but in an actual physical experience as well. So_COMMA_ a dance floor that asks you to step up and make a spectacle of yourself_COMMA_ for example_COMMA_ is a different experience than just looking at an object or performance as a viewer. I always thought of my teaching practice as collaborative_COMMA_ and I’ve been lucky through my teaching to have found an actual collaborative partner (you’ll learn a bit more about that in the next section). While here at the University of Iowa I have collaborated with another person in my department to build community through the organization of a queer print exchange portfolio that’s going to be shown at the Southern Graphics Council International Printmaking Conference. Part of the reason I wanted to participate in an MFA program was for the critical community and the opportunity for growth that can be experienced through collaborative thinking and dialogue. I’ve been lucky to have that community the past three years and I hope to continue to figure out ways to keep having it.,In 2012 I participated in an artist residency in Northern NM called PLAND (Practice Liberating Art through Necessary Dislocation). It consisted of living in a trailer for three weeks with my collaborator_COMMA_ who used to be my student_COMMA_ in the desert outside of Taos. Rather than write a description of it here_COMMA_ I would ask that you follow the link to the collaboratively written piece we wrote for the Notes on Looking website titled “Take A Sauna”. Thanks_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_http://notesonlooking.com/2012/10/take-a-sauna/,My most intense communal living experience would probably be that of a touring band. Several times in my life I have been on tour with more than nine people at once. Living in this way_COMMA_ making decisions_COMMA_ trying to find some personal solitude while packed in a van_COMMA_ sardined on the living room of some strangers house_COMMA_ or back stage_COMMA_ or even just being able to navigate the myriad issues that come up when nine plus egos are trying to find consensus on where to eat in some unknown city can be crazy making. I have found though_COMMA_ that I'm a good peace-maker. I've always been a good listener and very empathetic_COMMA_ but with little tolerance for BS and not really afraid to call it. That's served me well in these situations and I think that I’ve been an asset to my groups of friends in these instances_COMMA_ helping to alleviate tensions and opening avenues of communication.,Standing on the precipice of life after graduate school is terrifying_COMMA_ not because I’m worried about work (finding it or making it for myself)_COMMA_ or even because (like many of my colleagues) I don’t know what I want out of life. I DO know what I want out of life_COMMA_ and the terror comes from an understanding that the structure of our society privileges a certain type of person to achieve it. I know what it’s like to try and pursue a creative life outside of the academy_COMMA_ how the pressures of living make it more and more difficult to dedicate time_COMMA_ resources and physical and mental faculties to something that is often simply a labor of love_COMMA_ with little or no return. I’m interested in the session Unthinking/Unknowing because I want to challenge myself to do just that. I want an opportunity to think differently about my creative practice. How can I engage with it in different ways that don’t rely on what have become standard ways of making for me? Collaboration with Ari is one way that I have achieved that. In our own collaboration we ask how we can undo trusted modes of inquiry_COMMA_ use of critical texts and attachments to theory to become more articulate with ideas in an expanded realm of cultural production? This session and the description of the process seem to be exactly the kind of thing that will help us do that. All of this and engaging in a critical community and building relationships across disciplines and geographic location are why we would love to attend SMT. Timing is also important. I am dedicating this year to pursuing residencies before having to buckle down and get a job. July is when my new life begins.,,Ari and I recently had our astrological charts read in an attempt to better understand our fundamental differences and how they impede our communication. During our sessions with the astrologer a strongly coincidental similarity in our charts lead to the possibility that we had a relationship in a past life which ended tragically and that the current difficulties in our relationship might be the result of this past life trauma. If we had enough money to pay for it we would hire a hypnotist to lead us through past life regression therapy in an attempt to better envision how this past life narrative might take form. Our interest is in the metaphorical potential of this narrative to shed light on the actuality of our lived relationship and on the macro level parallels that our conflict might have in contemporary society. This closely relates to the theme of session B. Through this process we are working towards unthinking and unknowing our current modes of communication_COMMA_ stagnancy in our relationship_COMMA_ and to open up new and radical modes of relating to one another and the world. We see the potential to reimagine the possibilities of both our friendship and our creative collaboration.,I often ask myself “why art?” In a world where commodity fetishism and rampant neoliberalism rule the art market I wonder why it feels so important to do the work of cultural production. In the end_COMMA_ I realize that it is because the inquiry that happens through the creative process is ultimately valuable. That the questions that arise out of that process_COMMA_ and the process of sharing those questions and the tenuous and myriad answers that are sometimes produced_COMMA_ allow for different ways of thinking and hopefully_COMMA_ through a carefully articulated aesthetic experience_COMMA_ eventually_COMMA_ actual radical change.,none,facebook,I eat everything!

I am an artist_COMMA_ writer and chef; I recently graduated from university where I gained valuable insight into the process of socialization through a series of powerful participatory examples and am now trying to unpack the notions I have about how to be a productive and socially engaging artist_COMMA_ human and thinker. My recent artistic practice has taken form as a multi-disciplinary investigation of collaboration_COMMA_ competition and support_COMMA_ whether in the physical_COMMA_ psychological or interpersonal sense of the words. I work from two basic methodologies: the first being a critical model that investigates how things are and why and its counterpart_COMMA_ a productive model that proposes and enacts alternative structures._NEWLINE_I am invested in the power of social organization and solidarity—the ability of human beings to build agency_COMMA_ empathize more effectively and effect change by speaking and acting with one another. I have been greatly influenced by the critical pedagogy of Paulo Freire and Bell Hooks and the social theory of Michel Foucault. From these writers I have gained valuable insight into the power of discussion as a tool for social liberation and fluidity_COMMA_ an understanding that informs the structure_COMMA_ content and form of my own practice and my appreciation of art in general. My recent work has been as diverse as building a functional sauna for a nascent artist residency in New Mexico_COMMA_ founding a pop-up dinner club that raises and distributes funding for underrepresented artists and facilitating discussions with my peers about the course of the art world and how we view our futures within it.,I work individually about as often as I work collaboratively and place great value in the potential of conflict and difference to challenge my preconceptions and enable me to empathize more readily. My collaborative work varies in structure (some examples are physical objects_COMMA_ performances and interviews/discussions) and I do not necessarily seek projects in which labor and investment are equally divided (although this has happened in rare cases) but am open to a wide variety of ways of working with and learning from the people around me. I believe in the potential of art to act as a socially mobilizing force and_COMMA_ whether I work individually or collaboratively_COMMA_ value the processes_COMMA_ discussions_COMMA_ arguments and reactions that the work can engender over any physical product. I view discussion_COMMA_ education and collaboration as tent poles of my practice more so than any medium-specific categories and I am excited by the prospect of a residency program that is based on dialogue_COMMA_ mutual growth and education.,While in residence at PLAND in 2012 my collaborator and I built a functional sauna to serve as a bathhouse for future residents. Rather than describe the work here I have attached a link to an essay co-written by my collaborator and I about the project:_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_http://notesonlooking.com/2012/10/take-a-sauna/,While in residence at PLAND (Practice Liberating Art through Necessary Disclocation) in Tres Piedras_COMMA_ NM I lived in an off the grid trailer with my collaborator for three weeks. In addition to dividing the physical and conceptual labor of our project we shared domestic chores such as cooking_COMMA_ cleaning and maintenance of the space. The work we did while in residence became as much about the physical structure we were producing as the process of living and working with each other in an isolated environment.,The notion of unthinking/unknowing uncannily describes a feeling I have as a recent undergraduate. Art school was a blur of rapidly expanding potentials. My capacity to envision what art is or could be grew exponentially_COMMA_ at times reaching a critical mass that made any forward movement feel impossible. Now_COMMA_ that framework of critical mining is gone and I feel as though I have woken up at the bottom of the shaft. The important work ahead of me is to climb out of this space with the attention necessary to unpack what I found along the way. I have been given a powerful gift of multiple perspectives and the deconstructive tools necessary to balance them but what feels most necessary now is to forget everything I have been told_COMMA_ drop the baggage and find a way to make the practice I need for myself and my community real. Doing this is easier said than done and I know I cannot forget. But I can change my relationship to what I remember. For me_COMMA_ to envision thinking what I do not know how to think means making tangible what I know I need but cannot touch. I have touched many things like it but they all belong to others and do not quite fit me. I know I want to build something that can contain and support a collaborative yet challenging and discursive space_COMMA_ something that is responsive to the multiple desires of those involved and is flexible enough to meet them. I know I want this thing but as of yet it is only an abstract conglomeration of other structures_COMMA_ a reaction to what has come before. In order to think what I cannot think for myself I need to unknow what I have been told to want.,I recently attended a participatory group dynamics conference the goal of which was to analyze the dynamics of those attending as they emerged. In this structure (known as the Tavistock method) participants_COMMA_ supervised by a largely inactively participating team of psychiatrists and psychoanalysts_COMMA_ are divided into groups and given no further instruction but to analyze their group dynamics in the “here and now”. I found this method enlightening and productive and would like to organize a “here and now” session at SMT. This would consist of sitting together for about one hour and simply saying what we feel as it arises.,Jaime and I recently had our astrological charts read in an attempt to better understand our fundamental differences and how they impede our communication. During our sessions with the astrologer a strongly coincidental similarity in our charts lead to the possibility that we had a relationship in a past life which ended tragically and that the current difficulties in our relationship might be the result of this past life trauma.

The monastery is in a beautiful location and operates as a resort for the summer. During this time the students work full time (in addition to their practice) in exchange for room_COMMA_ board and zen instruction_COMMA_ in order to maintain and operate the resort. This three months of work supports the monastery as well as two others for the entire year. I want a school and residency program that is based on mutual support and collaborative life/work that engages capitalism in a way that the participants find comfortable in order to sustainably support the practices and lives of those involved.,None.,My friend_COMMA_ Jaime Knight,I eat all foods.

My name is Rebecca and I’m a multidisciplinary artist and designer who lives in Brooklyn_COMMA_ New York. You may know me from last summer when I started a project about visual poetics using images from Google Search by Image_COMMA_ madegreen smoothies and read a lot of Kenneth Goldsmith in the hammock. My time at SMT last summer not only was a launchpad for an important project I’m still working on and developing_COMMA_ but helped me refine the kind of artist and thinker I want to be and continue becoming._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_My creative and intellectual practice has thus far spanned many different disciplines_COMMA_ scales_COMMA_ and modes of making (from sculpture to video to performance to design to image-based work) but my interest in technology and digital media_COMMA_ and in exploring the larger questions they raise_COMMA_ is one of the threads that runs throughout my recent work. Working on my project at SMT last summer solidified for me that this is a thread I want to continue to follow (both conceptually and technically) and helped inform my decision to apply to new media art graduate programs for Fall 2014._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_At SMT this upcoming summer_COMMA_ I hope to build on the experience I had last summer and push it even further; make better work_COMMA_ speak up more_COMMA_ develop even closer friendships and have deeper conversations_COMMA_ go on more adventures. I hope to continue to open my heart and mind to others_COMMA_ to learn how to wander_COMMA_ and continue to stretch my definition of what it means to be an artist and a maker.,My creative and intellectual work is collaborative both in literal ways and more oblique ones. That said_COMMA_ everything I do creatively is fundamentally and deeply reliant on my engagement with other people. In certain modes of making_COMMA_ I work actively with a collaborator or collective in a shared process of making and thinking (such as in my work on RECAPS with my collaborator Martabel Wasserman_COMMA_ or in my design practice); other times_COMMA_ my work is more independent and self-driven but nonetheless informed by a dialogue with friends_COMMA_ peers and other artists and thinkers._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_My most recent body of work_COMMA_ visually similar imgs_COMMA_ grew out of a project that I started last summer at SMT and the direction of the work (which is still constantly shifting and changing) was shaped largely by conversations and feedback and experiences that I had throughout the course of the session. I’ve been fortunate to have other opportunities to present the work among peers and groups of people_COMMA_ and each time the feedback I receive and the dialogue I enter into is incredibly useful and fruitful for me._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Lastly_COMMA_ research is an integral part of my practice_COMMA_ and I see this as part of a process of collaboration in the sense that I am joining a dialogue or conversation that already exists.,http://rebeccalieberman.com/visually-similar-imgs-books_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_In David Buuck and Juliana Spahr’s An Army of Lovers_COMMA_ two poets come across a plot of land. Their initial discovery leads them through a progression of dream-like spaces_COMMA_ in which the plot of land is “also an enormous food court…not just a food court_COMMA_ but also an outdoor rehearsal space…not a rehearsal space_COMMA_ but a soundstage for gigantic live entertainments.” Through this protean space_COMMA_ in which theater is a warehouse is a bunker_COMMA_ the protagonists inhabit a universe in which things become other things_COMMA_ depending on how you look at them. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_In the kaleidoscopic odyssey of these characters_COMMA_ I see many of the questions that drive my work. My interest in creating a vocabulary of surrogates and substitutions is a thread that runs through both my major bodies of work to date: Whitetail Deer_COMMA_ A to Z and visually similar imgs. Through these projects_COMMA_ I’ve engaged with formal questions around the semantics of materials and the poetics of simile. I’ve explored strategies of remaking and restaging to estrange familiar systems and objects_COMMA_ and I’ve used formal grammars of equivalence_COMMA_ where things stand in for other things_COMMA_ to probe the contingency of meaning. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_visually similar imgs_COMMA_ which uses digital imagery culled from Google’s “Search by Image_COMMA_” currently exists as a group of artist books_COMMA_ a website-based image work_COMMA_ and a series of looped video projections. Gesturing at the seams of familiar technology_COMMA_ I use material mined from search results in which Google fails to match an image based on visual DNA. In these proliferations of “visually similar” analogs_COMMA_ images become material: shapes and forms_COMMA_ pixel topographies_COMMA_ histograms of the everyday. They take on the ability to shapeshift into other things—a scene from a sci-fi apocalypse film parades as a fiery sunset and a fluorescent hotel room—and in them_COMMA_ I see poetic equivalences among the nonsense. visually similar imgs attempts to articulate a digital poetics of search_COMMA_ in which a grammar of simile and substitution is formed from the internet’s detritus. Mute and fragmentary images are liberated from conventional structures of meaning and reconstituted as semantic building blocks_COMMA_ like words in a poem. A dreamscape unfolds across the pages of a book_COMMA_ and the browser doubles as a hall of mirrors where unstable objects endlessly mutate and multiply.,My most recent communal living experience was this past summer at SMT during Session B. Cohabitating with the seven or so other participants – cooking and eating meals together_COMMA_ sharing space in the barn_COMMA_ taking walks_COMMA_ making spontaneous morning smoothies and leaf collages – was a wonderful and fulfilling experience that I think allowed me to make better work_COMMA_ at the very least because I was so happy. Support structures of family and friends and roommates are incredibly important to me_COMMA_ and I understand the balance of giving and receiving that they demand._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Prior to that_COMMA_ my most substantial cooperative living experience was during my last two years of college_COMMA_ when I was a member and resident of the Dudley Co-op_COMMA_ a 32-person cooperative house for Harvard undergrads in Cambridge_COMMA_ Mass. My time at the co-op was emotionally_COMMA_ intellectually and socially crucial to my growth as a person and as a friend and as a thinker. Within the broader culture of Harvard_COMMA_ this community was a safe haven for me_COMMA_ my ideas and interests_COMMA_ and my changing identity. It was a place where I made incredible life-long friendships_COMMA_ activated my own political beliefs and was exposed to new ideas and people that destabilized many of my most fundamental assumptions about the world._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Being part of the co-op also gave me an important and lasting lesson in intentional living that has to this day impacted the way I treat my space and my community. Daily chores were part of the routine_COMMA_ as were attending weekly meetings to make community decisions and taking on longer “stewardships” to oversee larger things within the house.,I hope to participate in the SMT Hike this summer because I’m interested in taking on an experience that feels new and profoundly challenging to me_COMMA_ both on a physical level and an intellectual level. I look forward to having a creative and intellectual experience that takes place quite literally “in the field” rather than in the confines of the studio_COMMA_ or the pages of a book (though I imagine we’ll engage in those kinds of activities as well). _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Within the past two years_COMMA_ much of my making practice has become somewhat immaterial and screen-based_COMMA_ in a way that makes me long for the days when I made very material work (large-scale sculptures_COMMA_ woodworking and performance) and engaged my body in that process. Last summer at SMT when I was thinking about this_COMMA_ I became interested in the idea of a walking practice. I hope to see how that practice of walking might become or intersect with my practice (if only for a few days)_COMMA_ and I’m excited to feel what it’s like to be present intellectually as well as physically. I imagine being engaged in this different way might deeply impact the way I think and create._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I also hope to participate in the hike because I’m interested in sharing an intellectually and socially intimate experience with a group. I look forward to the kinds of bonds that form and conversations that emerge when people are removed from their everyday structures and environments and placed into this kind of new configuration.,I have many ideas for an immersive workshop or lecture to be given on the hike_COMMA_ but here are a couple. In the past few months_COMMA_ I’ve begun a meditation practice and so my first idea is to lead some kind of group meditation on the hike. It might be a sitting meditation (perhaps a Loving Kindness meditation_COMMA_ which is the kind I have been doing lately) or it could be a walking meditation_COMMA_ though I would have to look into these techniques a bit more. Either way_COMMA_ I think it could be a great group activity given the structure of the hike and the fact that we will be out in nature._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_My second idea is to lead sessions of structured making while on the hike_COMMA_ that are instruction-based and short in nature. Some ideas might be:_NEWLINE_- Make an object for walking_NEWLINE_- Make a work at the scale of the hike_NEWLINE_- Make a work at the scale of a stick_NEWLINE_- Make a work at the scale of a small pebble_NEWLINE_- Make a work using text,,Question: If you had to choose a question or organizing principle to determine the order in which people are to help themselves to dinner_COMMA_ what would it be?_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Answer: Mother’s first name_COMMA_ order determined by reverse alphabetical order,No!,The internet,I don't eat dairy

I see it as a system of symbols agreed upon and shared by a group of people; language is delicate and full of imperfections. In this sense_COMMA_ my work is necessarily collaborative; it needs the support and understanding of others._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_In order for my work to be witnessed in any way_COMMA_ the reader's (or listener's) vocabulary must meet with mine and intermingle. We may share common ground in regards to symbols_COMMA_ we may not; we may think that we share a common ground when_COMMA_ in fact_COMMA_ we don't (and vice versa). Because of this_COMMA_ my work is as much about the transmission of ideas as it is about the discovery and inspiration of new ideas. It is always a conversation._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Furthermore_COMMA_ my work is almost always borne out of the social experience. It is practically essential to my process that the subject-matter-to-be reveals itself to me through an experience 'out in the world'_COMMA_ be it through participation or observation. I find inspiration in the way meaning moves in and out of language; the way conversations that happen subtly in loud rooms_COMMA_ the way words can bear great meaning without intention_COMMA_ the way banal descriptions of things can be taken as psychic metaphors. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_My writing is most often an attempt at encapsulating a social event; one that happens in a quiet flash_COMMA_ or one that reveals itself very slowly and in many places._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_My writing is at once an accounting of and response to the curiosities of living as a social creature.,https://soundcloud.com/alvin_row-1/a-reading-of-conditional_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_This is a piece entitled 'Conditional Performance' and it marks two important firsts for me as a writer:_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_It is the first piece that I wrote that necessitates an oral presentation._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_It is the first time I've collaborated with anyone (editor's aside) on the composition of a piece of writing._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Because the creative process associated with it was_COMMA_ for me_COMMA_ new and experimental_COMMA_ I see it as an exciting yet somewhat flawed piece. I included it in this section not because I think it's my strongest work_COMMA_ but because it represents my willingness to explore as an artist and it showcases my budding interest in welcoming people into my process._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I began writing it_COMMA_ knowing immediately that it was an oral piece_COMMA_ but with no specific end in mind. When I was invited to read as part of the OBEY Convention (an outsider music and art festival in Halifax)_COMMA_ I knew that this piece needed to be a part of my performance. After working the piece into a near-to-final draft_COMMA_ I invited my friends Cat and Jeremy (a politician and musician_COMMA_ respectively) to workshop it with me._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Immediately_COMMA_ the two found themselves comfortably at opposite ends of the expressive spectrum: with Jeremy overly drab and Cat overly dynamic. As we worked through the readings_COMMA_ I invited the two to help develop their voices in the text_COMMA_ to sharpen the piece_COMMA_ adding and removing phrases and inflections as we three saw fit._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_As I eluded to above_COMMA_ I don't think it's an entirely successful piece_COMMA_ but I feel it offers multiple points of entry and a fair scope of my tendencies (good and bad). I am proud of it_COMMA_ unabashedly. I see the entire process behind it as a potential platform for work that I'd like to undertake at SMT.,In November of last year_COMMA_ I spent five days on an 'inquiry'. It consisted of a walk from Lunenberg to Halifax (roughly 109km) along a trail converted from an old railway track. I undertook this expedition alongside a visual artist_COMMA_ an architect_COMMA_ a basket-maker and a thespian._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The intentions behind the trip were varied and mostly implicit. Each of us had spent time living in both locations so (to my mind) it was an exercise in understanding the mental and physical distance between the two places; a journey which we'd all made many times in ride shares or hitchhiking in the years preceding the walk. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_It also served as a time to reflect collectively on artistic ideals. We found walking such a distance together helped facilitate a free exchange of ideas_COMMA_ histories and concerns as well as meditative silences. With a full five days of uninterrupted company and commitment_COMMA_ conversation took on deeper proportions._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The days were spent pacing towards the city. Each night we camped alongside the trail_COMMA_ sharing duties surrounding fire and food preparations. We slept five to a tent for warmth. The mornings consisted of stretching exercises_COMMA_ some readings from journals and discussions of trajectory.,I feel that the themes and structure outlined in the Unthinking/Unknowing session are in perfect harmony with my current artistic fascinations. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_My most recent work has been focused on the instances in which language fails us. I understand these instances to bear a kind of freedom. Rather than being problematic_COMMA_ I see the 'shortcomings' of language as opportunities to engage with symbolic or associative meaning_COMMA_ to work through ideas that would otherwise be tangled in reasoning or issues of clarity. I am interested in playing with the way the mind accounts for incomprehensible language. I have been trying to write without concern from comprehensibility. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Beyond that_COMMA_ I believe the social nature of the session will allow/insist that I explore more outside of the usual boundaries of pragmatic and poetic language. Early on in my development as a writer_COMMA_ I saw poetry as a mode apart from social instances; though often borne of social instances_COMMA_ I saw writing as a chance to speak outside of them_COMMA_ to speak free of the social restrictions of audience_COMMA_ time and space. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Now_COMMA_ as I become more confident and immersed in poetic language_COMMA_ and develop relationships that allow for more open-ended_COMMA_ exploratory exchanges_COMMA_ I see that it is possible (and deeply rewarding) to bring that type of language into the social context (rather than the other way around). The more I experience it_COMMA_ the more I find myself yearning for social exchange_COMMA_ for intellectual exploration_COMMA_ that allows me to use language unfettered by pragmatism or social mores and to have that kind of language returned in kind. I see this kind of exposure as entirely formative to my identity as a writer_COMMA_ and I suspect that I'll experience it in spades during this session.,,An even-numbered group makes a daylight trip to a lake (ideally on foot or bike). _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Upon arrival_COMMA_ the group is divided into pairs and designated either Onshore or Unsure._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Pairs then stake an area of the shoreline within sight but not earshot of the others._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The Unsure is then prompted to share with the Onshore an inquiry_COMMA_ fascination or psychic hurdle surrounding his/her practice._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The Unsure then swims a length of the lake (with option to break on the opposing shore)._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The Onshore develops a response to spur the Unsure deeper into his/her inquiry and re-opens the dialogue upon the pair's reunion._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The Unsure repeats his/her swim with a new question in mind._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_This cycle repeats until both partners agree they've reached a mental plateau_COMMA_ wall or divergence._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Once each group is done_COMMA_ all partners and roles are switched._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_After this second round_COMMA_ and a period of contemplation/rest/discussion_COMMA_ individuals are tasked with developing a brief affirmation based on their experience in the exercise (with the suggested exclusion of the terms 'I' and 'you')._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Once prepared_COMMA_ the group is divided equally amongst the two shorelines_COMMA_ and asked to pronounce their statements one after the other_COMMA_ across the water.,If you tried with all your might you?_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I won't_COMMA_ I might and I wouldn't.,NONE,ResArtis,NONE

I’m from Long Island_COMMA_ but I have lived in New Jersey for the past six years. I love literature_COMMA_ poetry especially. I like experiments with words and meaning. I look for art that feels as if it is revealed to me internally rather than added to me externally. I try to write poems and plays that make people feel like they are part of a common human experience (an experience that is more based in the idea of humanity than society). I try to be involved in whatever local scene I can and to learn from the artists in that scene. I have lived in suburbs and cities for all of my life and I would like a different experience than that. I think writing a bio is difficult. I am both quiet and friendly. My writing has lately revolved around salt_COMMA_ skin_COMMA_ golden_COMMA_ and ghosts. I have been dreaming of dirty water for a year_COMMA_ but now it is becoming clean. Some things I like are: dresses_COMMA_ card games_COMMA_ hot sauce_COMMA_ succulents_COMMA_ Sheila Heti_COMMA_ dogs of all kinds_COMMA_ mushrooms_COMMA_ sweet basil_COMMA_ myths and legends_COMMA_ foxes_COMMA_ hauntings_COMMA_ idiomatic language_COMMA_ mistranslations_COMMA_ Austin TX_COMMA_ Heather Christle_COMMA_ blood vessels_COMMA_ Richard Brautigan_COMMA_ Roberto Bolano_COMMA_ Yayoi Kusama_COMMA_ tacos_COMMA_ my family_COMMA_ bays and sounds_COMMA_ shells and fish_COMMA_ how one road can take you to any other road_COMMA_ windows_COMMA_ the radio_COMMA_ and infinity.,My creative practice is collaborative because my favorite way to write is through creative games_COMMA_ as well as because I often try to see how poetry can work with other art forms such as theater_COMMA_ music_COMMA_ and photography. Trying to create a kind of art that is not your specialty or that is outside of your realm of experience usually helps you to see your own art in a new and unexpected way. Playing inspiration and communication games with other artists and writers is a good way to shock yourself out of writing ruts (or any kind of artistic rut). I have found that artists of all disciplines work with a certain level of perfectionism and focus_COMMA_ and explaining your vision to someone else- how it is working_COMMA_ or not working_COMMA_ or how you have been changing it as the work progresses- helps you to clarify your own vision. I like to write based on clouds of ideas and I would like to do collaborative sessions that explore similar ideas in different mediums- even if the ideas are very broad_COMMA_ such as using an animal or a color or a local legend as a starting point_COMMA_ and then seeing where each person goes from there.,I think the chapbook that I have been working on is the work that best represents me as an artist that is fit for your program. The chapbook is called vertebrates_COMMA_ and is a collaboration with my sister- my poems and her photography. I wrote most of these poems with the feeling that one thing could be many things_COMMA_ or at least with the feeling that one thing could be something else. I am open to experiments with voice and form_COMMA_ and am extremely curious and willing to learn about almost anything. I think the most important part of writing this was how much I learned while doing it. It clearly doesn’t read as an academic or scholarly work_COMMA_ but to write these poems I first wrote pages and pages of notes on the meanings of different plants and flowers_COMMA_ Pagan and Roman symbols and history_COMMA_ human biology_COMMA_ different forms of reproduction_COMMA_ New Year’s traditions_COMMA_ and ideas about death_COMMA_ among other topics. I also took notes on various readings in nonfiction_COMMA_ fiction_COMMA_ poetry_COMMA_ and drama_COMMA_ and from studies of visual art. I am very curious and excited and interested in learning_COMMA_ and I hope this comes across in my work. I would love to be able to take this to the School of Making Thinking and have a whole month to work and learn in a new and creative environment. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-3JMOVy-UR8NjFxdGdlM0NXWkU/edit?usp=sharing,I have been living with roommates for the last six years_COMMA_ so I am very used to communal living situations. I currently live with eight other people in a house in New Brunswick_COMMA_ NJ. I have lived in two houses where most of the other people who lived there were also artists or musicians: my current house (Jones)_COMMA_ and my house from 2011-2012 (Fire Island). I also briefly moved back to Long Island while I was interning in the city_COMMA_ and very soon after that my house was destroyed in Hurricane Sandy_COMMA_ so I spent six months saving money_COMMA_ replacing possessions_COMMA_ and learning how to be a very polite guest. I know that communal living requires always doing the dishes_COMMA_ even if not all of them are yours.,I am applying for the Between Nature and Culture: Reconstructing Wildness session. I think that this session will help me develop as a thinker and as an artist because it is a topic that I am extremely interested in and would like to explore more. I am a tame person who feels connected to wild things. I am very interested in animals_COMMA_ humans_COMMA_ bodies_COMMA_ and nature_COMMA_ and how they all interact (especially in ways that feel true to the feeling of being alive). I would like to gain a greater background and framework to write about wildness from. Also_COMMA_ I would love to have the sensory experience of being in the Catskills for a month_COMMA_ and to be able to leave having developed new associations and a new vocabulary for describing nature and wildness in my poetry.,The workshop/immersive lecture I want to lead would be based around texture_COMMA_ meditation_COMMA_ and poetics. I would want everyone to collect objects with different textures- stones_COMMA_ grasses_COMMA_ flowers_COMMA_ anything- and then to meditate while feeling those textures. During this meditation_COMMA_ I would like to discuss the different textures and structure/lack of structure present when creating works of art_COMMA_ how much of an influence environment has on creation_COMMA_ and how much control an artist has over the direction their work goes in after it has begun. Possible texts that I would use for this are “Invisible Architecture” by Barbara Guest_COMMA_ “Some Notes on Organic Form” by Denise Levertov_COMMA_ “The Poem as a Field of Action” by William Carlos Williams_COMMA_ the preface to Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman_COMMA_ and Madness_COMMA_ Rack_COMMA_ and Honey by Mary Ruefle.,The workshop I would lead would be a foraging expedition led by someone who knows the Catskills very well. The Catskills are good for foraging- specifically for ramps_COMMA_ chanterelles_COMMA_ chestnuts_COMMA_ beechnuts_COMMA_ blueberries_COMMA_ strawberries_COMMA_ amaranth_COMMA_ violets_COMMA_ mustard greens_COMMA_ chicory_COMMA_ and dandelions. The communal foraging and eating would be followed by time for personal creation or reflection. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Foraging is a practice that is in the domain of the very “civilized_COMMA_” high-end culinary culture of New York_COMMA_ as well as the wilder history of the area. How can foraging be so completely civilized and wild at the same time? The same question applies to art. Art is a way to express both wild and civil feeling_COMMA_ and indeed expresses some of the most “wild” and most “civilized” ideas of our time and throughout history. Foraging for nutrients_COMMA_ medicines_COMMA_ and decorations also provides a jumping off point for thinking about how creations develop- how you combine what you learn from society and what you gather from the outside world with your own personal tastes to create something unique. A workshop on foraging and its associated rituals would work very well as a way to investigate the questions that the seminar focuses on.,Question: Kelly_COMMA_ how badly do you want to go on the hike and take the Between Nature and Culture: Reconstructing Wildness class? _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Answer: Very badly!,None- I have off from work for the whole month of June.,The Internet,Wheat- but I will happily bring my own bread/pasta
3/1/2014 0:59:35,Ilana,Harris-Babou,ilana.harrisbabou@gmail.com,9176089482,ilana.harrisbabou@gmail.com,USA,Hartford_COMMA_ CT,1/14/1991,www.ilanahb.com,http://bit.ly/1hsmYHc,Session A (BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE // RECONSTRUCTING WILDNESS),"I am an artist and educator living in Hartford_COMMA_ Connecticut. I feed myself in two ways: First_COMMA_ I am a fellow in the Studio Arts Department at Trinity College. I advise seniors on their thesis projects_COMMA_ am a teaching assistant in Steffani Jemison’s Video Studio course_COMMA_ and install shows on campus. Second_COMMA_ I work in the Hartford Public School district_COMMA_ where I collaborate with high schoolers on murals after school and tutor recent immigrants in classes that include Engineering_COMMA_ Graphic Arts_COMMA_ Biology_COMMA_ History_COMMA_ and Civics._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_In my studio I have been working between wet-paint_COMMA_ light_COMMA_ sound_COMMA_ and video to make ephemeral paintings. This performative process is documented in video and sometimes leaves behind still artifacts.The interactions in my work are alchemical_COMMA_ turning awkward mass into luminous gold. Occasionally I inhabit a character made from the materials in my studio_COMMA_ the focus of the lens_COMMA_ and the painterly metaphors of rap lyrics. She is an obscured ""video vixen_COMMA_"" caught in the act of building the set surrounding her. Sometimes she seems pressed under glass. Sometimes her costume and figure disintegrate into pattern and light. Her studio is one stage upon which she can melt her own violent or tender experience of content and rhythm. She scratches this itch so hard that she peels back the synthetic skin of the image – only to find another layer of vinyl or Formica beneath it. In a moment of weakness she eats the ice cream she intended to paint with. A jug of acrylic paint slips from her hands and spills. She reaches for it_COMMA_ in a power grab._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I am still trying to elucidate the nature of this power. Sometimes it seems contained within the space of the screen_COMMA_ and sometimes it extends into the substance of inarticulate social interaction.",I am applying to SMT as one half of a collaborative duo with Samer Sabri. We began working together as undergraduates at Yale University_COMMA_ and together we have explored a broad range of ideas by creating novel questions_COMMA_ objects_COMMA_ and contexts. In the past_COMMA_ each of us has claimed “authorship” over works we have created collaboratively. We are ready to claim dual authorship_COMMA_ and to attempt to make unauthored works._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Samer has been a character in my videos and has helped me figure out how to situate the works in space during installation. My videos are highly visceral_COMMA_ and their placement in relationship to the human figure is not incidental. I’ve helped him think through computer games and produced the layout and the graphics for some of them. We maintain an ongoing dialogue which catalyzes every stage of our individual processes. We've learned to present ideas to each other at earlier and earlier stages of our creative process and have gotten used to thinking of the other person as the one who helps narrow things from a vast universe of possibilities_COMMA_ rather than the one who simply shifts the course of a work that had already embarked upon a particular path._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_All of my work depends upon augmentation by others. When my collaborators come before the camera they are self conscious. I often set up a narrow space and set of gestures within which others may act. My lens captures the blank stare that originates from a moment caught off guard. Human frailty in a “glamorous” moment is what lends the work its humor and its tragedy. My practice is about timing. Sometimes it is rhythmic timing. Sometimes comic timing. My own beat falls into and out of alignment with that of those surrounding me.,The Work: http://ilanahb.com/UNTITLED-INSTALLATION-2012/solo_NEWLINE_Password: SMT2014_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I worked with Zimbabwean artist Rebecca Aston to make an interactive light installation at the Yale School of Art. Programming was unexplored terrain for me before embarking upon process that led to the work. It began when our personal ways of forming light in space collided. She was saw the code first: its ability to track and to mimic. I had been focusing on the ways light framed and tracked a body moving through space._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_We responded to the ways individuals navigated space in the School of Art. Where was movement predictably directional? On the stairs. On which staircases were people in a rush and on which did they meander? We were privy to the spoken and unspoken collaboration of the students moving through the building. We projected light and saw what happened._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_We tried to capture the hypothetical sensation of existing as silhouette in Hype William’s dizzying video for the crunk hit “Snap Your Fingers.” The result was a projection which tracked the shadows of people as the moved down the stairs with a rainbow of flashing colors that disappeared as quickly as they arose. The work blinded visitors as the moved up the stairs. All the while_COMMA_ the screeching_COMMA_ yet addictive beat looped endlessly in instrumental._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_This project came to mind when I came upon the passage on “Collaboration/Individuation” on the SMT website. While working with Rebecca (and learning from those who encountered our work by happenstance)_COMMA_ my own personal voice was articulated with new-found clarity. Collaboration simultaneously defined and expanded the boundaries of my practice. I believe this occurred because of a willingness to change directions in response to feedback rather than get stuck upon prior work and expectations. Our joint efforts were additive_COMMA_ rather than oppositional.,When I was 17_COMMA_ I spent 6 weeks living in the Telluride House at Cornell University. The program was free. I lived with 29 students_COMMA_ reading theory_COMMA_ cleaning house_COMMA_ and finding our own voices. The course I took_COMMA_ “Caribbean Dialogues[.com]” was taught by two Jamaican art-historians named Petrine and Petrina. A key part of the program took place outside of the classroom_COMMA_ in the echoing victorian house we inhabited._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_As high school students_COMMA_ we were responsible for deciding collectively how we wanted to interact with the academics we were given access to. We cooked our meals and had a say in how the program budget would be allotted. Some early proposals included spending all funds to fill a room floor to ceiling with ping-pong balls. All choices were determined during evening meetings which sometimes stretched 8-12 hours. We would vote_COMMA_ debate_COMMA_ and vote again in an attempt to reach a kind of consensus. We almost never slept_COMMA_ drifting in a fog full of new ideas. This experience cemented a belief in me that in small communities where mutual respect is a given_COMMA_ massive mistakes and grand triumphs are possible in small amounts of time.,One question posed by the course description excites me in particular: can we embody wildness? In many ways_COMMA_ it seems as though we create the wild. It is formed on every edge by the boundaries of what we deem ordered. And so_COMMA_ if it is we who make wildness_COMMA_ can we make ourselves if we choose to embody the wild?_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_My practice will benefit in several ways from SMT. The work Samer and I have embarked upon together can grow in an environment which does not place a premium on creation’s adherence to a specific discipline. The process-oriented nature of the session aligns with the way we work. Everything begins with conversations about a larger theme. Sometimes there are tangible remnants of these conversations. Sometimes all that is left is an immaterial lens through which new ideas can be viewed._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_My practice will benefit from a process which seeks to let go of “self-constructs.” Many of my videos chart a kind of hyper accumulation of self-construction. I attempt to capture in the moving image the visual and emotional congestion which occurs when one is acutely aware of being gazed upon: so much so that the screen they stare out from becomes an endless mirror to posture in front of. I want to attempt to break this mirror_COMMA_ pick up the shards_COMMA_ and see what is reflected there. Perhaps in this gesture my work might find a new way to approach wildness._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Samer and I have written a purposefully porous proposal. The work we will do at SMT will be greatly shaped by the way others move through it. Where my work has previously been about pushing up against the hard membrane of the fourth wall_COMMA_ I would like to see what happens when it is pierced completely.,n/a,We are interested in the historiography of addiction and its relationship to notions of wildness. Is the addict one who has fully tapped into her inner wildness_COMMA_ or one who is completely submerged beneath systems of organization?_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The perceived pervasiveness of addiction is seated in societal anxiety. People choose to cling to the trope of an autonomous self making decisions independently. Faced with the utter failure of this model_COMMA_ they decide that the only kind of person that exists outside of it is the addict_COMMA_ the one of with no control. They thus end up turning every possible tendency and desire into a potential or actual addiction._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_We want to create a series of “addictive games” which will unfold amongst the community at SMT. Later_COMMA_ we will write “code from conversation”; computer games whose structure responds directly to the play as it unfolds._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The games will be inflected by the broken rhetoric of 12-step programs_COMMA_ and influenced by Halberstram’s notion of fruitful failure. 12-step programs frame addiction as an accepted and unilateral state of being. We will build a program that seeks to cure the anxieties framing addiction_COMMA_ rather than the addict herself.,Samer’s question for me: How can repulsion and attraction be polar opposites yet coexist?_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_A shivering_COMMA_ goosebumped fear spreads through me when I encounter certain patterns. It’s the allure of things that seem organic yet eerily ordered: shapes that remind me of cells reproducing uncontrollably. When I see a scary pattern_COMMA_ my mind returns to it for hours. I have to relive the experience_COMMA_ often sharing an image with people I know share this disposition. Google “Trypophobia.” Many people think trypophobia was willed into existence by internet hypochondria. For me_COMMA_ the fear is real_COMMA_ and so is the allure.,I foresee no conflicts with this summer's scheduling.,Rate my artist residency,I don't eat shellfish

I am currently a 4th and 5th grade math teacher in a Lebanese public school._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_My technical background is in mathematics_COMMA_ theoretical computer science_COMMA_ and systems programming. I am currently branching out to web programming and writing games for my students_COMMA_ using the “game mode” they get into to teach them math._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I have been devoting a lot of energy to improving life and learning in my classroom. I’m always trying to see what my students see and steer them to what they need to see with the least amount of pain necessary. That means creating silly games_COMMA_ computer games_COMMA_ stories_COMMA_ or activities for new ideas to make sense._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Each day I obsessively break ideas_COMMA_ events_COMMA_ or thoughts down into their most basic components. This habit ties into my background in philosophy. I work in a circular way; meaning that I focus on patterns that are repeated across very different domains. These patterns often even end up appearing in the very structure of my thoughts about them_COMMA_ thus creating a motif akin to a fractal._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I write my philosophical ideas on a blog called “The Analyst of Random Things” (tartisme.blogspot.com)_COMMA_ and I also write a blog on Lebanese and regional politics (in which I am very engaged) called “A country of strangers” (acountryofstrangers.blogspot.com)._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I am starting as a Business Analyst for McKinsey and Company in Silicon Valley next fall; I think that will allow me to continue improving as a communicator and a problem-solver. I am particularly excited about learning to conceptualize solutions to “systemic” problems because they are intellectually fascinating and they plague my region of the world.,I am applying to SMT as one half of a collaborative duo with Ilana Harris-Babou. We began working together as undergraduates at Yale University_COMMA_ and together we have explored a broad range of ideas by creating novel questions_COMMA_ objects_COMMA_ and contexts. In the past_COMMA_ each of us has claimed “authorship” over works we have created collaboratively. We are ready to claim dual authorship_COMMA_ and to attempt to make unauthored works._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I have been a character in Ilana’s videos and I have helped her figure out how to situate the works in space during installation.

Ilana has helped me think through computer games and produced the layout and the graphics for some of them. We maintain an ongoing dialogue which catalyzes every stage of our individual processes.

The world of quotidian thought functions much more within that shifting_COMMA_ polymorphous universe than within one of cleanly ordered_COMMA_ axiomatic definitions. I want to keep digging and try to understand it better. This process is impossible without conversations with people about how things become important_COMMA_ and it is in these conversations that I am closest to the structures I am constantly trying to unearth.,I was taken by the statement “Learning is an openness of one’s identity to other’s practices and projects” on your website._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_For my senior thesis in Ethics_COMMA_ Politics_COMMA_ and Economics_COMMA_ I wrote about responsibility for structural injustice (http://bit.ly/MCxGAL). In short_COMMA_ structural injustice occurs when social relations (unfairly) advantage one group over the other overwhelmingly in many dimensions. Structural injustice is_COMMA_ in the vast majority of cases_COMMA_ outside of the control of a single individual or a narrow group. Ending a structural injustice usually requires some form of collective action._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_In my thesis_COMMA_ I try to provide a good conception of individual responsibility for structural injustice; my solution is rooted in virtue ethics. I think this work represents me well because it emphasizes that the questions I focus on are questions that I mull over in my daily life and that I believe everyone ought to think about._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I also use several different ways of progressing through my ideas: Chapter 1_COMMA_ where I explain why a virtue ethical approach is ideal to solve the problem_COMMA_ is much closer to analytical philosophy_COMMA_ with definitions and arguments that are clearly stated and structured. Chapter 2_COMMA_ where I argue for the particular “virtues” I have selected - such as “putting background conditions into question” - I use what I call a dialectical approach. I also include frameworks and arguments from other domains_COMMA_ such as game theory and mathematics (pp. 60_COMMA_ 61_COMMA_ 62) or English literature (pp. 66_COMMA_ 67_COMMA_ 78)._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I really enjoy making connections between and borrowing methods from very different disciplines and sources to think about a question that’s too “human” and multifaceted to be confined to one discipline or approach. Through my way of working_COMMA_ I can contribute to – and gain a lot from – being at SMT.,Last summer_COMMA_ I went on a backpacking trip to South-East Asia and Eastern Europe with my roommates from college. We’d lived together for the past 3 years_COMMA_ but this trip was a radically different experience. We were nomadic: together from the moment we woke up to the moment we went to sleep for 6 weeks. We had never been to most of the countries we visited_COMMA_ and had very little time in each place. We had to make decisions all the time: where to sleep_COMMA_ what to see_COMMA_ what to eat_COMMA_ how to respond to crises_COMMA_ how to get to the next place._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I think that we knew each other well enough that we knew when to delegate concerns to the right person and trust that person. For more difficult sticking points_COMMA_ my place in the decision-making process was to step out and refine – almost formalize – positions and objections to help the debate stay focused. We strove to find the most satisfying answer rather than the most satisfied victor. We learned to pick our battles and avoid nitpicking when not important or urgent. This trip made us all more patient and better at decentering ourselves.,I think SMT is the best place for me to get better at thinking across fields and methods. Working with Ilana has allowed me to realize that I tend to enjoy instrumentalizing mental content. I am often trying to fit ideas into a framework that includes a thesis_COMMA_ arguments_COMMA_ and counterarguments._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I would like to get to a place where I’m exploring with a wider scope of ideas without being constantly on the lookout for “the point” or “the right answer.” This is where the concept of the wild comes in. This concept poses a complex question: the “wild” is very often used to designate a territory that is foreign but also meant to be subdued; is there a way to “open” ourselves up to what we designate as wild without trying to “conquer” it?_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Even if that means letting go of the concept of the wild_COMMA_ is there a way to access this territory while respecting its integrity? It seems to me that if there is one_COMMA_ it has to come with a complete change in our mode of consciousness; our mode of appreciating the world.,,We are interested in the historiography of addiction and its relationship to notions of wildness. Is the addict one who has fully tapped into her inner wildness_COMMA_ or one who is completely submerged beneath systems of organization?_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The perceived pervasiveness of addiction is seated in societal anxiety. People choose to cling to the trope of an autonomous self making decisions independently. Faced with the utter failure of this model_COMMA_ they decide that the only kind of person that exists outside of it is the addict_COMMA_ the one of with no control. They thus end up turning every possible tendency and desire into a potential or actual addiction._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_We want to create a series of “addictive games” which will unfold amongst the community at SMT. Later_COMMA_ we will write “code from conversation”; computer games whose structure responds directly to the play as it unfolds._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The games will be inflected by the broken rhetoric of 12-step programs_COMMA_ and influenced by Halberstram’s notion of fruitful failure. 12-step programs frame addiction as an accepted and unilateral state of being. We will build a program that seeks to cure the anxieties framing addiction_COMMA_ rather than the addict herself.,Ilana’s question for me: Please provide an in-depth description of the sensations you felt during a time you were lost in the act of making._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Recently_COMMA_ I got stuck on the 6th problem of this online programming contest: https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/feb14.

My ancestors came over in Winthrops Fleet_COMMA_ just ten years after the Mayflower.

Tall tales_COMMA_ true tales_COMMA_ absurdist yarns (complete with talking raccoons)_COMMA_ and uniquely American war stories (Paul Revere is an ancestor) were my inheritance. Yet_COMMA_ I was uniquely drawn to visual storytelling in a way that was unheard of in my family. I studied Art History in undergrad_COMMA_ and went on to work in art galleries in London_COMMA_ New York and Los Angeles. While in LA_COMMA_ I started taking classes from Judith Weston author of ""Directing Actors"" and directed some plays for her theater. I was completely hooked. I applied to NYU Grad Film_COMMA_ got in_COMMA_ and I recently graduated. In the last two years I have been scrambling to make money (those student loan collectors are relentless!)_COMMA_ and to start a Directing career.",Filmmaking is_COMMA_ by its nature_COMMA_ collaborative - and thats the best part of it. There is an electricity_COMMA_ when one crew members idea spark’s anothers and then anothers_COMMA_ and soon you are creating something together that is far more resonant than any of you might have created on your own. That kind of interconnected creation is what drew me to filmmaking in the first place.,I’d like to show you my short film Crazy Glue. https://vimeo.com/22425398_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Crazy Glue is based on a short story. Prior to it I wrote all my own films... but I got myself into a little trouble when I wrote a film about my family. Though the film came out well (audiences responded well - I will never forget watching the waves of laugher as the erupted in the theater - it was a profound kinetic and cathartic experience for me) my father was displeased. Since then I have had trouble opening up and channelling such truths. I am not sure what makes me fit for your program_COMMA_ but I do know why I need a program like yours. I want to open up again_COMMA_ and brave channeling the truth of my own experience. Your residency feels like a place to take risks.,Every living experience I have ever had has been communal. I have always had roommates - at one point I even lived in a factory loft with 10 photographers! I like to laugh and I value the unintended interactions that are a part of everyday when you live with many people. I like that a casual conversation around the toaster can spark a great idea. When you live alone you have to bring all the magic yourself. Its possible_COMMA_ but not nearly as fun.,I am applying for Between Nature and Culture // Reconstructing Wildness and Unthinking/Unknowing because I am intrigued by both of them and well convinced that they could both do my imagination some good._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_At this point in my Directing career my job is to write a screenplay that is a pure expression of my voice. Squeezed in in the hours around my paper pushing day job_COMMA_ I fear my writing has become stilted_COMMA_ stale_COMMA_ a room in desperate need of an open window. It lacks surprise. It lacks wildness. Its too full of knowing and lacks the essential unknowing. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_A residency with other artists and thinkers would help me let the magic back into my tired brain_COMMA_ I believe. In my work I strive to delight an audience. I don't think that is a frivolous pursuit. Making sense and un-sense_COMMA_ if you will_COMMA_ of the world is the artist job. We must reframe human experience in a way that enlightens it. But to do so we must be channeling these thoughts ourselves - and that is why I hope to do a residency at The School of Making Thinking. I love the idea of being in a place to run wild_COMMA_ physically and intellectually_COMMA_ and seeing where that takes me and my work.,,"Well_COMMA_ I would like to write_COMMA_ and interact_COMMA_ and write_COMMA_ and interact_COMMA_ and write. I have a New England story in my head - but I need to get out of NYC and stand on New England dirt to give it space to be born._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I've also long had this idea of open air plays for a small audience. For instance staging Tennessee Williams ""27 Wagons Full of Cotton"" on a back porch at dusk. I love the idea of an audience that is out in the weather - feeling the air on their skin in a really intimate environment_COMMA_ hearing the crickets chirp as the sun goes down_COMMA_ watching a beautifully performance of a well written text. There is an intimacy in that that reminds me of sitting around the fire listening to my grandparents and uncles tell stories when I was a kid. A primal storytelling experience. In fact_COMMA_ instead of putting up a Williams play_COMMA_ what I'd really like to do is write a play for the occasion myself. It'd be fun to even have it be a ""walking play"" where the audience has to_COMMA_ unexpectedly_COMMA_ get up and follow the actors into a field (where the play continues) and then into a cave (where it culminates).

I'm Cassie. I'm a 31 year-old teacher_COMMA_ audio producer and multimedia artist. I live in South Brooklyn with my two dogs and my friend_COMMA_ Sarah. I'm originally from Madison_COMMA_ WI and lived there primarily until I was 25. I was raised by liberal hippies and decided I wanted to be a radio host after watching Molly Shannon and Ana Gasteyer host Delicious Dish on SNL. What great turtlenecks! _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Radio is my jam. I have been co-hosting and producing a live_COMMA_ queer_COMMA_ feminist radio show called Romantic Friendship for three years. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I am also currently finishing up my M.F.A. in Integrated Media Arts from Hunter College. My thesis is an hour long radio documentary about my family's experience in an evangelical Amish mennonite settlement in northern Florida in the 1950s. It's an exploration into group identity_COMMA_ belonging_COMMA_ and the Amish values that live on in my family. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_For work I teach: radio production_COMMA_ new media_COMMA_ and journalism at SUNY Old Westbury_COMMA_ and robotics to elementary school students. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I love to be outside and walk in the woods. I also like knitting very simple things_COMMA_ drinking beer_COMMA_ and making hand-made birthday cards. Most things are political to me and I like to have fun_COMMA_ sexy conversations about life and politics.,My longest standing and most intensely collaborative project is my radio show_COMMA_ Romantic Friendship. My co-host_COMMA_ Sasha Wortzel_COMMA_ and I conceived of the project together three years ago_COMMA_ and have made all decisions around content_COMMA_ production and distribution together since. It is both challenging and extremely rewarding to work collaboratively on this show. There have been moments of frustration (and near demise) – but for me_COMMA_ the collaboration is what keeps the show going. It gives energy and life to the project. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Being a live radio show_COMMA_ we are also collaborating with our guests and the community of hosts and project managers at BBOX_COMMA_ our radio station. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I teach media production at the college and community level – and this is also a collaborative process. In this role_COMMA_ I am actually providing space and guidance for my students to collaborate with each other. I have learned so much about how to be effective in this role in the last few years. When I started I was way too hands-on_COMMA_ and stressed out about making sure the final product was top-notch. This distracted from my students ability to experiment and be creative! I feel much more confident now in respecting the process – rather than focusing only on the end product. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Funny side-note_COMMA_ I opened my CV yesterday to update and upload_COMMA_ and remembered I had given myself the tagline “audio producer_COMMA_ teacher_COMMA_ collaborator.” Made me chuckle a little.,Links: _NEWLINE_http://sogsounds.com/_NEWLINE_http://www.prx.org/pieces/101233-farmer-confession-booth-i_NEWLINE__NEWLINE__NEWLINE_In 2013 I was selected to participate in the Andes Sprouts Society residency_COMMA_ a program based on the idea of bringing artists and farmers together to create new ways of thinking about food_COMMA_ agriculture and the natural world. The main project I created during the residency was SOGS – a daily recording project that combined documentary and sound meditation. I also mounted a “Farmer Confession Booth” for our barn art show_COMMA_ and showed a short film about the foodways of my Amish-Mennonite grandparents – projected onto the side of the barn. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_As residents of the farm we also worked on the farm and at the farmers market. The combined experience of creating art and being part of a working farm community was beautiful and stimulating.,In 2009 I worked for the Montana Conservation Corps as a Youth Crew Leader. I spent many weeks out in the field with my crew_COMMA_ which consisted of six teenagers and my co-leader. During the day we build trails and fences_COMMA_ and at night we cooked_COMMA_ ate_COMMA_ played_COMMA_ did lessons_COMMA_ set-up and took down camp. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_What worked? Silliness. Unstructured time to balance out the structured time. Going to bed early so we could be alone in our tents. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_This was a particularly interesting communal living experience because of the gap in age and cultural background. One night it was my turn to cook and I made quinoa. None of them had ever heard of it before_COMMA_ much less eaten it. The next day everyone was pooping_COMMA_ a lot_COMMA_ and I became the subject of many jokes about poop-inducing hippie food. I wanted us to eat healthy out there_COMMA_ but in the end I compromised and started making pasta instead. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I had a more traditional communal living experience living at a cooperative house with 32 other people in Madison_COMMA_ WI. We shared food_COMMA_ supplies_COMMA_ cooking_COMMA_ communal spaces and decision-making.,I am drawn – in both body and brain – to the “Between Nature and Culture // Reconstructing Wildness” session. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Last year at my residency in upstate New York I tapped into a community of artists and farmers with strong ties to both country and city. As a native Wisconsinite – and someone who has spent their life canoeing_COMMA_ hiking_COMMA_ and chasing dogs – I feel a similar “pull.” And yet_COMMA_ I am learning to see these urges (to country and city) not as diametrically opposed_COMMA_ but as mutually constituted. They exist together. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I tap into a different kind of creativity when I am in nature. My city self is frenetic and pop-culturey_COMMA_ fueled by a turbulent and productive anxiety. My wild/nature self is . . . more physical. Less scared. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_One thing that sounds exciting about the session is the opportunity to work with artists who work in more physical mediums – especially dancers and musicians. I have a background in both (from way back) and I wanna stretch these muscles.,,I definitely want to sing_COMMA_ especially outside_COMMA_ and combine voice with environmental soundscapes. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Also: feminist bookstores. Two years ago I started a documentary film about A Room of One's Own Bookstore_COMMA_ in Madison_COMMA_ WI – a place I used to work and one of the oldest feminist bookstores in the country. They had recently moved locations and doubled in size_COMMA_ at a time when feminist bookstores all over the country were shutting down. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The story of this film is about survival_COMMA_ adaptation_COMMA_ and crafty/shifty ways of changing meaning and connotation through time. I'm interested in our narratives around natural selection – and how we apply this biological model to economics and society. What happens when we equate natural selection with capitalism?,What can chihuahuas teach us about our wild selves? _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_People often think that my little dog is wimpy and fragile. He appears that way when he's walking on his leash in his little pink coat. But take of the coat and the leash – and he is a sure-footed little creature. He climbs mountains and trots through snow!,No scheduling conflicts at this time,Facebook - Sharon Mashihi,I don't eat beef_COMMA_ pork_COMMA_ cheese

I started out in this work of portraiture 10 years ago_COMMA_ when I left university studies and made a documentary about what it means to be an artist_COMMA_ from the perspective of 4 homeless men in Dallas_COMMA_ TX. In the years since_COMMA_ I lived in Philadelphia and worked for a college prison education program that brings university students and incarcerated students together as peers for intergroup dialogue. I was also teaching art in the Philadelphia jails. I received a grant in 2008 for a portrait project in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia_COMMA_ using plants growing on the roadsides and lots of the neighborhood to dye silk. I created a series of 10 portraits of neighborhood residents using batik_COMMA_ embroidery_COMMA_ and applique. (Please see the Kensington Portrait Project on my website.) I will be exhibiting this work in Philadelphia summer of 2015_COMMA_ and will be collaborating with residents to design the exhibition. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I moved to Toronto in September 2013 to pursue a graduate degree in Environmental Studies at York University. My program requires that students create and fulfill research towards a self-designed plan of study. My work is currently focused on how to intervene in cycles of social violence using arts-based approaches. A main question of this work is how patterns of thought and action are maintained_COMMA_ and ways of intervention that can allow for new_COMMA_ yet unexplored_COMMA_ avenues to emerge. My focus and realm of inquiry for this work is on group and collective-based approaches to social intervention. My artwork in exploring this topic includes performance_COMMA_ video_COMMA_ textiles_COMMA_ and installation_COMMA_ with a focus on testimony and witness.,In my work in prison education_COMMA_ my role was to facilitate group processes and coordinate collective projects. Influenced by educational practices of facilitation and curriculum development_COMMA_ my approach to research and artistic practice is oriented towards the creative capacity of groups. My practice is community-engaged and oriented towards impact on social issues. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_My process begins with conversations_COMMA_ either individual interviews or group conversations_COMMA_ around a particular question or set of questions. (A question I’m currently working with along with others is_COMMA_ “How can we understand social violence as a form of addiction_COMMA_ and what are markers of this historically and culturally?”) From this collective dialogue and input_COMMA_ I work by myself to develop mediums and processes of exploring the topic artistically_COMMA_ and create a body of work in response. Sometimes my individual practice is a form of research for understanding the question more deeply_COMMA_ and sometimes my own work enters back as working material for a larger group process. The original question becomes expanded and deepened_COMMA_ and enters back into collective art production and exhibition or performance. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_It is an important way of learning for me to work with other artists_COMMA_ offering feedback or entering collaboratively into their processes. I learn from the methods and mediums that other artists use and I see the process of working in community on individual or collective projects as exponentially enhancing each person’s growth.,My most recent work_COMMA_ completed in December 2013_COMMA_ and to be exhibited at York University in April_COMMA_ is called “Safety Net”. This work explores trust and risk in relationships. In line with my process of working collectively_COMMA_ I designed a series of performance-based workshops exploring personal narratives in ways that asked participants to take risk in revealing and telling their stories in public settings. Participants gave me feedback that the collective process allowed them to make actions and speak in ways that they would never have otherwise done_COMMA_ especially in public. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I documented the group workshops from above in video_COMMA_ as way of gaining visual representation of how people choose to take risks in relation with others. I then projected this video onto a wall and traced the movement of people through space using thread and pins_COMMA_ as a way of creating a more tactile and aesthetic sense of individual choices and collective movement around risk and trust. I made a second video of this pin and thread process as a form of self-portraiture that then became the backdrop for a performance piece. In this 10 minute performance_COMMA_ I kneeled on the floor in a darkened room in front of the projection and read letters about risk and trust in a personal relationship of mine with an incarcerated friend. (Please see the link to the video work.) _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_This work was a way for me to explore the potentials and challenges for collective work that depend on the willingness of individuals to trust and make relational risks. “Safety Net” was also a way for me to take risks as a facilitator and artist_COMMA_ because I was choosing an entirely new way of working. This was my first work of self-portraiture.,In summer 2013 I lived for 3 months with 12 other people at the Herb Pharm in southern Oregon. This was an internship on medicinal plants_COMMA_ and involved farming for 8 hours a day_COMMA_ 4 days a week_COMMA_ and intensive evening and weekend classes. As a group_COMMA_ we were responsible for cooking_COMMA_ cleaning_COMMA_ shopping_COMMA_ and organizing our household. We all lived together in a large house with shared rooms. Each person was responsible for cooking breakfast and dinner for the entire group 2-3 days out of the internship. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I also co-facilitated a two week undergraduate study abroad program in La Paz_COMMA_ Bolivia. For this project about 12 students all lived together in a guest home in the city and shared quarters and coordinated creative works amidst a collective living environment.,After working in the context of prisons and jails and in community-engaged art projects looking at how to address and change social problems_COMMA_ I’ve arrived at a line of questioning on how to intervene in dominant notions of reality. I’ve been engaging ideas of systems thinking of late_COMMA_ and through this literature I’ve discovered that the highest levels of intervention in social and environmental problems is in changing consciousness and ways of thinking. So far I've discovered that this requires the letting-go of control and allowing new arrangements of human_COMMA_ plant_COMMA_ and animal relationships. Artistically_COMMA_ it requires a willingness for improvisation_COMMA_ and as “Safety Net” highlighted_COMMA_ a willingness to take risks on the unknown. The Unthinking/Unknowing session seems directly related to my work and line of questioning about the role of art in social intervention. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The residency will aid in my development by allowing me an extended time to enter into these conversations creatively_COMMA_ and allow me the space and time to explore these themes of intervention and consciousness through an embodied and collaborative process. I think it is very important to work with others in exploring the question of how we think and how we take a leap into the unknown_COMMA_ since collective intelligence and creativity allows and provides for new ways of action. I hope that that the residency becomes a space for me to create a project or small body of work that can enter into my work as an artist-facilitator with community groups.,,I envision a project that involves the mapping of geographic landscapes in juxtaposition with conceptual maps around a particular topic such as “connection” or “interdependence”. This project would engage collaborators in multiple interpretations of the theme in various mediums_COMMA_ including photo transfer of symbolic or metaphorical images_COMMA_ along with the cutting and rearrangement of geographical or topographical maps. It might also include pictures and diagrams of plants or bodies in relation to each other. Other mediums would include music and choreography exploring connection in time and space. The final work would be an exploration of themes of interdependence that emerge from the group process around questions and challenges of social action. The final exhibit would be an installation and performance venue_COMMA_ with the goal of offering new options and ways of thinking about how to define self in relation to landscapes and other living beings.,What is a map?_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_A map is a way of understanding the meaning of physical_COMMA_ emotional_COMMA_ and cultural terrains. A map can show the body_COMMA_ the land_COMMA_ social environments_COMMA_ mental landscapes_COMMA_ and cultural representations of perception and reality. Always situated within and exhibiting a social worldview_COMMA_ maps can show how people create and share meaning. Stuart Hall speaks of “shared maps of meaning” or the representations of reality that people understand in relatively synonymous ways within cultural contexts. Mapping can be used as a method of exploring notions of time_COMMA_ space_COMMA_ place_COMMA_ and identity.,I have a family wedding on July 19th_COMMA_ so may need to leave the session early if I do travel for that occasion.,Adriana Disman,no allergies

Those performances often took place in the public sphere_COMMA_ and whether they were more participatory or solitary_COMMA_ relied on others to help activate these moments._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_These days_COMMA_ my work has become less focused on direct interaction and more engaged with the possibilities of traditional media_COMMA_ such as sculpture and film. To that end_COMMA_ my collaboration with others has shifted mainly to that which is peer-based_COMMA_ through conversation where ideas are shared and feedback is provided.,mountains and hillsides enough to climb' (2003) was a performance wherein I ran an ad for four weeks in the classified section of the Montreal Mirror_COMMA_ a free alternative weekly_COMMA_ that read: SEEKING PEOPLE FOR 3-LEGGED WALKS.

The walks lasted anywhere from1 1/2 to 4 hours._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Inspired by the 3-legged races regularly featured in my elementary school activities_COMMA_ 'mountains' sought to emphasize community over competition. While during typical 3-legged races_COMMA_ each ankle-bound pair are cooperating in order to compete_COMMA_ the participants in a 3-legged walk are simply cooperating. Removed from its original competitive structure_COMMA_ these 3-legged walks brought various strangers and myself together_COMMA_ cooperating for the simple sake and pleasure of walking. Along with having to negotiate factors such as touch_COMMA_ stride length_COMMA_ speed_COMMA_ and direction_COMMA_ the insertion of our temporarily conjoined bodies into a familiar locale facilitated a re-imagining of how to aimlessly wander the city._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_'enough to cross_COMMA_ enough to last' (2007) took place in Banff_COMMA_ Alberta_COMMA_ and was an extension of 'mountains'. For this performance_COMMA_ I solicited certified hiking guides to go on private 3-legged hikes with me. The hikes lasted 1 1/2 to 4 hours_COMMA_ and took place on various trails of different levels of elevation gain and intensity. During our hikes_COMMA_ the guides provided a verbal narrative of the trails we were on. Along with the physical challenges of navigating mountainous terrain while bound at the ankle_COMMA_ my intention was to complicate the assumed manner in which official tours of Banff trails were normally experienced_COMMA_ and present a form of new logic with the insertion of two temporarily and purposefully conjoined bodies in the landscape._NEWLINE_http://beckyip.ca/enough-to-cross-enough-to-last,I’ve spent some time volunteering on organic farms through the organization_COMMA_ WWOOF. One summer a few years ago_COMMA_ I volunteered on a few organic farms throughout Ontario with a friend. One of our stops was at an eco education centre in Eastern Ontario called Earthwalk. The centre attracted different people who arrived and left at different times. Some of us slept inside and some of us tented outside. Meals were prepared_COMMA_ eaten_COMMA_ and cleaned up together. Each meal took place at the dining room table. We would begin by choosing someone to select a card from the Angel Oracle deck to read aloud. Then_COMMA_ each of us would state an intention or reflection_COMMA_ and together_COMMA_ we’d give thanks before eating. This centre was also in the early stages of building an eco village about an hour’s drive north of where we were. We travelled to the village together_COMMA_ set up camp_COMMA_ and spent some time volunteering there as well.,I've always been interested in the interstices between official_COMMA_ unauthorized_COMMA_ and imagined narratives_COMMA_ and in exploring the ghosts of memory_COMMA_ history and place. In my current work_COMMA_ I’ve begun to explore plant and animal cultures_COMMA_ folklore_COMMA_ and symbolism as they relate to personal history and mythology.

My work has undergone the process of being purely representational to becoming phenomenological in essence_COMMA_ hence sometimes immaterial in its brief experientiality. I am after embodied research_COMMA_ walking being my prime methodological tool. My practice aims to find ways to communicate my belief that the process of thinking is yet another sense_COMMA_ and not the purely mental activity that rationality is understood as in our culture. It attempts to find ways of reuniting the body and the mind through work that is both experiential and intellectual in nature and reception._NEWLINE_I am interested in hybridity and impure systems as ways of survival and endurance —mainly as sources of sustenance. I find duality and established categories of subjectivity/objectivity to be at the core of Western culture’s inadaptability to the future on earth. I am searching for ways of being in the world that are less dysfunctional_COMMA_ both as an individual and within the social as body. My practice is geared towards building opportunities to nourish one or several of the means of experience a person has available to align_COMMA_ disalign_COMMA_ realign_COMMA_ that person’s patterns_COMMA_ including myself. It aims to find ways to attune to behaviors and find transformative ways to new ones. Lately I am focused on the process of being in nature and spending time with it as a learning possibility to enable behavioral awareness and change. I believe a critical/rational understanding of any given situation needs to be coupled with an experiential and embodied process. The benefits brought about by a durational exchange nature~human_COMMA_ while searching to understand this relationships from a non-hierarchical perspective_COMMA_ will allow a more balanced understanding and mode of being. I hope this therapeutic process will bring reciprocity to the relationship.,I believe in the interrelatedness of all live and inert beings. In this sense existence is a collaboration between a particular space and time and a particular state of being within a dynamic system —all in constant flux. This engenders positive and/or negative_COMMA_ long-term and/or immediate_COMMA_ outcomes. Within this framework_COMMA_ and speaking only of intra-species collaborations_COMMA_ I collaborate daily with my family_COMMA_ friends_COMMA_ peers_COMMA_ colleagues_COMMA_ neighbors and fellow New Yorkers as well as with absolute strangers_COMMA_ aiming to have the scale lean towards the positive —nurturing the life aspect._NEWLINE_On the creative/intellectual side_COMMA_ as a process where 2 or more persons tackle together an idea from different viewpoints_COMMA_ working within a set of similar parameters and the common will to an outcome of sorts in mind —with partial or total effacement of individual authorships— I see my practice as highly collaborative. Formally and phenomenological I have consciously engaged in collaborative work with colleagues in walks_COMMA_ writing poems_COMMA_ and composing music/performances under the framework of indeterminacy and blind collaboration that Cage and Cunningham are well known for. I have also collaborated in a formal curatorial project for the exhibition “Notations_COMMA_ the Cage Effect Today_COMMA_” and informal events involving communal walking_COMMA_ foraging and cooking (“What mushroom? What Leave?”). I am currently researching embodiment as knowledge generator in collaboration with an artist/preacher_COMMA_ engaging in field and theoretical research walks; and participate in a collaborative shifting group (IWT) for specific projects. I consider exchanging feedback about specific work —as in a studio visit— to be a collaboration of sorts._NEWLINE_Also I highly consider the visible/experiential portion of my practice to be collaborative in a dialogical sense_COMMA_ in that participants are invited to take part as conscientious performers where the outcome is dependent on the participant_COMMA_ yet indeterminate and open.,PRESENT_COMMA_ 2008-09; MoMA PS1_COMMA_ NY._NEWLINE_During 9 months I sat for four hours at a time reading to myself (full list of titles here http://bibicalderaro.com/artwork/1426296_Present.html) and writing my instantaneous thoughts in a typewriter. I was searching for the roots of the financial collapse of 2008-09 in our economic system: Greek philosophy_COMMA_ the Enlightenment; reason as pure thought; reason as only possibility for thought and knowledge; ethics and epistemology. The writings were offered to the public as a gift_COMMA_ a copy of all typewritten pages given away was kept aside and later bound together in an artist book_COMMA_ and published in the paperback PRESENT. All typewritten pages are now an expanded poem that resides in the homes of those who attended the performance._NEWLINE_PRESENT is a multidimensional performed essay where I attempted to reduce the exuberance of thought to words; it’s a durational poem that gives thought a chance to communicate; it’s language as membrane and thought as sense; it’s a bridge between the left and right hemispheres_COMMA_ between the rational and the intuitive_COMMA_ between the past and the present_COMMA_ between form as stasis and form as a floating_COMMA_ changing dimension._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_-WALKING AS KNOWLEDGE (text~walking)_COMMA_ 2013_COMMA_ Bs.As.

LP houses books about aesthetics_COMMA_ theories of perception_COMMA_ epistemology and environmental ethics._NEWLINE_Fifteen artists were invited to participate in a collaboration that was part chance_COMMA_ part agency_COMMA_ as we walked_COMMA_ read and interacted with the urban environment. The participants chose titles from LP to do loud readings at first sight within the group_COMMA_ in the street._NEWLINE_The weaving of texts juxtaposed with the street landscapes and changing neighborhoods makes walking a way of knowing as performatic process.,My most recent determined isolated act of communal living was participating in the Walking Seminar_COMMA_ during the summer of 2013_COMMA_ in Puerto Rico._NEWLINE_The WS was a pedagogical experiment that invited 12 international artists to participate during 3 weeks of walking in PR. We walked out of San Juan heading East and South_COMMA_ camping at unspecified sites for 3-4 nights at a time._NEWLINE_The exposure to the intimacy and endurance of camping in non-campground places_COMMA_ without running water or bathroom_COMMA_ challenged the group in severe ways —many members had never camped before. As well_COMMA_ exposure to differing cultural patterns and language barriers made this experience an interesting mini-social laboratory._NEWLINE_Individual and group responsibility_COMMA_ ethics and trust are key components that I highlight as important elements in a communal living experience that thrives to engage the creative. The WS lacked the organization and transparency needed to allow or support these. Yet_COMMA_ my own personal synthesis of this experience recovers the incredible potential of camping as restorative and creative process —both at an individual and group level— while understanding the importance of a clear mission statement and the need for determined facilitation of leadership —or_COMMA_ again_COMMA_ the clear disclosure of its absence.,My practice is based on the liminal spaces of the in-between —the gaps left by silence and non-doing— to understand processes of formation and transformation of body_COMMA_ thought and matter. I work on such fluctuating processes understood within the biological construct of the membrane as hinge_COMMA_ bridge_COMMA_ connector_COMMA_ to contextualize the production and categorization of knowledge and of being._NEWLINE_Currently I’m searching to make sense of thinking as another perceptual sense with which humans are equipped to experience and “know” the world. I’m also after understanding how being in nature can develop into a process of reciprocal attunement that facilitates changing old behaviors and/or inventing new ones_COMMA_ including that of thinking. Methods to create new patterns of thought and behavior interest me in particular_COMMA_ in the search for truly innovative ways of being in the world oriented to an ecology based on post-humanist ethics._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Thinking/not thinking and knowing/not knowing are fluid concepts that may happen in solitude yet may be enhanced by dialogic correspondences with people and environment. The process of communicating any such instances require at some point the need of naming; this use of thinking in its making is of utmost importance in my practice._NEWLINE_I would like to be able to further challenge this understanding as a methodology and pedagogy. Also_COMMA_ in practicing this understanding_COMMA_ I would like to help shape its theory._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Participating in this residency would allow me to collaborate with fellow artists and thinkers in this direction_COMMA_ while developing an understanding of differences that will make any theory and practice more robust. To engage in knowing/not knowing_COMMA_ thinking/not thinking_COMMA_ naming/not naming within a durational_COMMA_ immersive experience would immensely help shape the research I am proposing as a practitioner of art and thought.,,,How does a threshold shift/change?_NEWLINE_Given that the world is a continuum in which we exist_COMMA_ I am only speaking of humans’ understanding(s) of the world._NEWLINE_The durational aspect of this question and its potential answer(s) make it difficult to establish one particular way in which a threshold changes. What interests me is the embodied nature of the dialogical self_COMMA_ how we embody experience from perceptions that become emotions and behaviors_COMMA_ into fabricating “knowledge_COMMA_” sets of paradigms fixed to a given reality._NEWLINE_Walking in nature as method of realigning emotion/behavior/knowledge production into a dynamic understanding of sets may bring answers.,,I don't remember! but I'm happy I did,eat everything but prefer no red meet

I think of my work as a construction of processes or encounters that mean to reach a state of questions. Through creating opened games that take participants out of their comfort zones_COMMA_ I experiment different possibilities of interactions with the other_COMMA_ what is around and the idea of intensity. These processes might or might not be documented and can take forms such as video_COMMA_ installation_COMMA_ performance_COMMA_ interactions_COMMA_ happenings and other hybrid ones. I was living in New York for that last 2 years while doing an MFA program in Fine Arts at SVA and just moved back to Rio de Janeiro. I will have my first solo museum show in Rio this month_COMMA_ after winning a grant from Caixa Cultural.,My practice is all about human interactions and does not happen without the other. In my pieces I have the role of a “proposer” or someone who sets up the parameters for the processes to happen_COMMA_ and these processes only happen when there are other people. I also work with collaboratos who help me with more specific expertises that my work might need – technology_COMMA_ camera_COMMA_ sound_COMMA_ building spaces_COMMA_ etc.,Thoughtfeeling workshops were first developed at SMT in 2012 and I have been reshaping them according to space and people since then. These are long silent interactions for 2 people (preferably strangers) with a specific space exploring the notions of spasms of life_COMMA_ presence_COMMA_ closeness and sleep. The workshops are site specific and the space around is a strong influence on what will happen. Participants have their notebooks to communicate through writing with each other and have to stare at each other’s eyes for the whole experience. Thoughtfeeling workshops are not documented.,School of Making Thinking 2012.,Thinking x feeling_COMMA_ individual x group_COMMA_ discussion x meditation and immersions are very relevant topics of questions that come out in my work. The idea of being led into this intensive workshop fascinates me because in my work I act as the conductor of experiences. Being involved in experiences myself is fundamental for what I am proposing and the hybrid structure that is proposed here really interest me. Also_COMMA_ I am very curious to be introduced to concepts by Deleuze_COMMA_ Roberto Freire and Paulo Freire in a non academic way.,,"I would make an event in which everyone should be sleeping or trying to sleep.

The viewers could choose (consciously or not) where in the spectrum between sleeping and awake they would be. In the end they should write down any dreams they could remember that would serve for inspiration for the next event. The invitation would be something like - ""take some rest from yourself"".",How can one experience presence? How is this related to an encounter with the other? How can one experience life without becoming immune? What happens to one's life when openness and un-immunity play fundamental roles? To which extent is it possible not to protect oneself?

My father is a first-generation Iranian immigrant to the United States. My mother is American. Language in my household was frequently confused. My father’s first language is Farsi. Often_COMMA_ I heard Farsi spoken but I did not know how to access its meaning; I was not taught the language. Its sounds_COMMA_ unfamiliar and pure_COMMA_ were structured in a rhythm and pace that felt like a secret code. How do you access meaning if you do not know the code? _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The entanglement of movement and my creative impulses started to highly develop at age ten when I decided I wanted to be a modern dancer; I dedicated myself to serious study. I played the role of pantomime_COMMA_ reaching out to express while keeping silent. In my late teens_COMMA_ I developed anorexia and bulimia. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Developing my illness and getting help was a realization that I did not know how to speak; I never had a voice of my own. During my undergraduate studies_COMMA_ I delved inward trying to find what was important to me. The answer came back to language and movement_COMMA_ but now embodying images and sounds. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Working with the moving image is a complex process in structure-making and concept-building. I often think of my process as a form of collage. Ultimately_COMMA_ my work questions authority: who or what is visible/heard_COMMA_ and who or what is invisible/unheard. How do these positions create an in/ability of action? _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_In Fall 2013_COMMA_ as an Iowa Arts Fellow_COMMA_ I initiated my studies at the University of Iowa in the MFA Film and Video Production program. I am exploring the moving image as a language_COMMA_ which communicates voice as a body of image and sound structures.,Collaboration appears throughout my practice in many forms. In one sense_COMMA_ there is the collaboration between my conceptions and the technology I am engaging with to manifest these visions. Experimentation with formatting_COMMA_ software platforms_COMMA_ sound feedback_COMMA_ etc require a lot of trial-and-error and manipulation of various tool sets. Working with equipment_COMMA_ keeping footage organized_COMMA_ and consistently locatable is a constant challenge I face and without digital technology I would not be able to do what I do. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_In another sense_COMMA_ when I am constructing a video piece_COMMA_ getting feedback from my peers and professors is an important ongoing conversation I engage with. This allows for an open forum of thought to be presented while also helping me question what I am making_COMMA_ really helping me see what is in front. Work can become difficult to read during the process of its making. Having a few voices you trust to help you sift through the mess of thoughts going on in one’s head is a great help._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Lastly_COMMA_ as far as working with another on a collaborative project_COMMA_ I am currently incorporating more hands-on multi-crew projects. Working in the theatre and designing sound for a stage play was a jump in another medium completely_COMMA_ but engaging with a community of artists who posed many questions to me to were looking for answers I could provide to shape an overall vision. It was taking what I know and applying it to the needs of the play’s text. Essentially_COMMA_ adding an elemental framework within a framework. At this juncture_COMMA_ I am working on a performance piece with my colleague Kasia Plazinska. Both of us have never done a project quite like this before_COMMA_ so we are building it from the ground up together each step of the way.,Human Body Battleground Organ Organism_COMMA_ 2013_COMMA_ 9m 30s_COMMA_ dv_COMMA_ appropriated collage_NEWLINE_https://vimeo.com/77166279_NEWLINE_password: exhausted in this unfolding_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The following moving image work was created in a self-directed production course during my first semester in graduate school_COMMA_ Fall 2013. As the title notes_COMMA_ the body is the subject matter of interest. But not a body we can easily define or depict a corporeal presence. More so_COMMA_ this body is a body of image and sound structures that begin in a state of declaration but reveal the fissures of language structures throughout its duration. The Human Body Battle—work demonstrates how a sense of playfulness_COMMA_ humor_COMMA_ with a heavy dose of biting subversion permeates my work. Here they blend together creating a voice_COMMA_ which instigates a complex set of questions upon the viewer rather than posing closed answers. _NEWLINE_Here is the synopsis: Human Body Battleground Organ Organism is an appropriated moving image collage investigating the penis and vagina as disembodied vessels. By utilizing a digital voice to enact this estrangement_COMMA_ a narration of declaration generates a questioning of definitions_COMMA_ where sound and image structures dismantle and reveal a deconstruction of audio-visual form and subject's signification._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Currently_COMMA_ this work is on tour with The Black Maria Film Festival.,Every summer from the age 12-18_COMMA_ I participated in a “dance lock-in” with my fellow dancers. The lock-in was a mixture of celebration for all the hard work and effort we put into our dance training during the year but it was also an exploratory moment for us to creatively express ourselves by ourselves_COMMA_ to be the authorial voices of our choreographic jams._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Imagine_COMMA_ at any hour of the day for three days_COMMA_ collaborating_COMMA_ choreographing_COMMA_ goofing around_COMMA_ practicing and costuming a production number with your best friends. We were locked in our dance studio with no adult intrusion on our creative project. We were creating a dance production from the ground up. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_At the end of the three days_COMMA_ we had the showcase dance recital. It was a blast. This kind of communal living_COMMA_ even though temporary and for a short period of time each year_COMMA_ it was the event I looked forward to most. Getting to work together_COMMA_ be together_COMMA_ and celebrate our love of dance was very special to me and I understood that it was something not everyone got to do_COMMA_ to bond with those they deeply admired about something they deeply admired and live it together.,I am most interested in participating in Unthinking/Unknowing seminar. For me_COMMA_ my art practice correlates to a type of unthinking/unknowing with each project I start. It is through my art making I explore a conception that I do not know how to decipher. It is only through the process of building_COMMA_ piece by piece_COMMA_ that any answers/resultant bodies of texts reveal themselves to me. Even though I predominately work on the screen_COMMA_ I am interested to further expand my practice to involve multi-media performance where the incorporation of my body_COMMA_ moving images and sounds will affect a space with which I am engaging. This seminar explores the unknowing body_COMMA_ movement_COMMA_ and thinking that is involved in my way thinking and making at the current moment. Participating in this will allow for bother professional and personal growth for me and I look forward to the possibility to engage with this open forum of questioning.,,,What did you dream about last night?

To sum myself up (right now)_COMMA_ I'm into rediscovery_COMMA_ however applied_COMMA_ but I'm dabbling with ideas of collective re-identity as alternative education. And my favorite color is all shades of green. And I box on the weekends.,The genre that my work is most often categorized in is conceptual or performance art. My aesthetic investigation always involves the human body and its interaction with other bodies_COMMA_ human or not. Most of my projects are collaborative in some way. I’ve produced a few projects that literally involve the aid of another person for the entire process from brainstorming ideas to prepping gallery walls. Though_COMMA_ what I find most interesting about my practice is that most solo pieces become collaborative in the final stages. I think that is a big distinction of performance art from other forms of live art_COMMA_ be it theatre_COMMA_ dance or otherwise. The audience participates_COMMA_ unknowingly or not_COMMA_ in the summation of the project. For example_COMMA_ a street intervention piece can be premeditated and conceptualized up until the point of performance. Then the window that has been left cracked open allows for the viewers/audience to alter the course of the work. A swelling crowd_COMMA_ a snickering adolescent_COMMA_ a snail or a frog’s unexpected interaction can change what is ultimately seen and interpreted through the lens of documentation._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_A more explicit and relevant example of this happened during a project set in a remote area in the Georgian forest. The intention of the piece benefited from isolation to highlight ideas of reclusivity and fear. However_COMMA_ I was not actually afraid. On the day of the performance_COMMA_ a group of hikers stumbled upon my performance. The shock and/or fear (due to costuming) that became present from both parties had an effect and enhanced_COMMA_ in my opinion_COMMA_ the outcome of the piece. The link to this project can be found here: http://amberry03.wix.com/portfolio#!trickster/cnvv,"This first link I've provided below is a project with brief description called Divided Actions. I think it reflects the conceptual nature of my work and examines some core ideas relevant to what can be imagined at ""A Summit on a Summit"" hike_COMMA_ such as mapping_COMMA_ wandering_COMMA_ and collaboration. The project was originally conceived in a class environment to then be ripped to shreds by Marina Abramovic in a studio visit. So we advanced the original project (following strangers as spectacle) to becoming invisible stalkers_COMMA_ think Sophie Calle or Vito Acconci. I liked how it turned out._NEWLINE_Link 1: Divided Actions_NEWLINE_http://amberry03.wix.com/portfolio#!divided-actions/c16ln_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_My second link below is another more recent project called iMapping (implicit mapping) that also involves following and mapping but hyper-focuses on the abandonment of social constructs. Like Divided Actions_COMMA_ I am following strangers but this time in a large metal encasement on wheels (my car). There's something about the protective shield that one's personal car can provide. In this context_COMMA_ it's a safety bubble. It’s an external_COMMA_ literal and metaphorical framework preventing my body/self/ideas from touching yours. I give this project as an example for “A Summit on a Summit” because it is an extension of thoughts formed originally from the nature wandering in the first project I’ve provided_COMMA_ Divided Actions. And I’ve asked myself a number of times whether I consider the unknowing participants of these projects (the persons followed) to be collaborators. Essentially_COMMA_ yes_COMMA_ but it’s something I’m still chewing on._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Link 2: iMapping (implicit mapping)_NEWLINE_http://amberry03.wix.com/portfolio#!imapping-implicit-mapping/c1r6c",I would say that the majority of my adult life (post-undergrad) has been some form of communal living. And because of this_COMMA_ I've found myself often at the doorstep of family and friends that will take me in for short spurts of time. More specifically_COMMA_ during the past few years as a graduate art student_COMMA_ I've lived out of my car_COMMA_ had a run at living in a 2 bedroom city townhouse in Atlanta shared by 6-8 people_COMMA_ and crashed the majority of the time at a sculpture studio at my school (Savannah College of Art and Design). _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_More appropriate to this question though_COMMA_ is my 6-week residency in rural India where a group of international artists shared a space that was an empty library--can you even call a library a library without any books? We were told it was a failed attempt by an ambitious NGO but nonetheless_COMMA_ the 15 to 20 mosquito nets gathered on top of individual decorated mats will paint my memory for years to come. As a supplementary note_COMMA_ chai was absolutely the connecting source for the residency_COMMA_ some would say food_COMMA_ or the art produced_COMMA_ but I say chai.,"I am applying for 'A Summit on a Summit"" hike for a few reasons. For one_COMMA_ I am interested in Guy Debord's or the Situationist idea of the derive and psychogeography. As an expansion of urban wandering_COMMA_ to wander within and among a sensuous landscape develops this solopsistic platform in the mind. I want to find and develop chaos here. I want to stumble upon and create order here. And more importantly_COMMA_ I would like to bare witness of this development with other thinkers. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_My opening-up process for discovering new ideas involves a liminal step-by-step process --which follows van Gennep’s rites of passage: separation_COMMA_ transition/unlearning_COMMA_ reincorporation or reidentity. The process is usually in environments that border nature and civilization_COMMA_ like paths within forests_COMMA_ human-made grooves in trees. The process is often solo_COMMA_ so I question how the shifts in identity and unlearning identity can transfix and become valued as a group. As mentioned before_COMMA_ I consider my work to be collaborative in general but usually that collaboration comes into being at the final stages of production or during the performance itself through audience participation. But it has been atypical for collaboration to occur in the thinking process_COMMA_ the initial stages of conception. I'm curious to change/experiment with the process of conceptualizing prior to a project with other vigorous thinkers/artists. I'm interested to watch and interact with the blank stage in others' minds_COMMA_ and how they begin to fill that stage when actively engaging_COMMA_ moving with our **animate environment. Is it a replication of what is visually seen? Is it possible for us to see/envision/feel the same thing? And aiming towards the social realm of my practice_COMMA_ can our inevitable differences be processed in this way as post- ""ist""_COMMA_ e.g._COMMA_ racist_COMMA_ sexist_COMMA_ ageist. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_**Just as a distinction_COMMA_ I don't think I believe in inanimate things.",My mobile workshop deals with fear as an inherent part of our identity and how it aids our understanding of rupture. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Questions that help structure what rupture is and can be:_NEWLINE_1) The physical body goes for days without food_COMMA_ how can you sooth that rupture? What is hunger in the context of this hike?_NEWLINE_2) Light enters the eye through the cornea_COMMA_ what happens when the cornea is ruptured (lights out)? Can you imagine other areas for light to enter?_NEWLINE_3) If a specific group_COMMA_ say the people hiking_COMMA_ is a concrete community _COMMA_what could rupture them/us? Do we fear this separation? What would bring us back together?_NEWLINE_4) To me_COMMA_ the largest rupture of all time occurred as a nick of the skin underneath a mustached man whose prejudice initiated one of the largest atrocities of human history. A metaphorical nick_COMMA_ an irritation that erupted in hate-fever. How do we bring that fever down?_NEWLINE_5)Some symptoms of traumatic rupture are loneliness_COMMA_ anxiety_COMMA_ disorientation. Can we orient each other by disorienting ourselves? How?_NEWLINE_6) Imagine fantasy without nature_COMMA_ what is it?_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Potential exercise:_NEWLINE_The act of eating is often a congregational meeting. We nourish each other through conversation and company while eating food. What changes when the act of communal eating is merged with the eating process itself? I feed her_COMMA_ she feeds me; she feeds him. What changes when this process is used for one meal? Two meals? Every meal? What happens when we skip a meal_COMMA_ when rules are ‘enforced’ in one of our basic needs?,N/A,Q: By engaging in alternative learning situations are we approaching freedom?_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_A: Do we attempt to rid of the institution_COMMA_ with its rigid lines and frameworks_COMMA_ its premeditated system of order? Do we seek to demolish it’s walls to rebuild our own? Or to exist without a social structure at all (is that even possible and if so what does it look like?) Or do we simply seek an equal seat in the house? _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_ARE WE SEEKING RELEASE OR ARE WE SIMPLY WANTING AN EQUAL SEAT IN THE HOUSE?_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I seek release or I simply want an equal seat in their house.,I don't foresee any scheduling conflicts.

Formally_COMMA_ I am trained as a dancer and choreographer_COMMA_ making embodiment the primary application in a practice that has become seamlessly interdisciplinary. My performances negotiate the real with the spectacle and target the psychosomatic using gesture_COMMA_ video_COMMA_ collected objects_COMMA_ slide shows_COMMA_ milk_COMMA_ love letters_COMMA_ tape recordings and most recently microwaves. I superimpose narratives of illness_COMMA_ consumption_COMMA_ the self and the feminine using a cross-referential logic of sign symbols. Either as a mantra or a mode of mechanical reproduction I find it necessary to repeat words_COMMA_ images and gestures over and over. Meaning is never the same but also nothing new is ever created. I enjoy this perplexity._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I value both those things that are understated_COMMA_ and those that are overstated. I search for a real feeling but I also like punch lines and entertainment. I consider performance mostly as a situation made up of signs_COMMA_ which include the people_COMMA_ action and that which we sense (see_COMMA_ hear_COMMA_ smell ect…). I look to create disorientation by subverting those signs. Disorientation allows for re-orientation and this is where we see the politics of performance. Politics are embodied. Lately I am interested in the economy of performance via the potentially assigned values of gesture. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_My days are made up of the following activities in any set of combinations:_NEWLINE_Drinking coffee_COMMA_ running up the mountain_COMMA_ going to the studio_COMMA_ performing my ""waitress to pay the bills"" performance series_COMMA_ eating beautiful food and making love to my lover. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I work alone but also in collaboration with the collective WIVES_COMMA_ performing regularly in various venues including galleries_COMMA_ lofts_COMMA_ theatres and music venues. Currently_COMMA_ I am preparing for 8-hour durational performance titled “digestion/liquidation” which will be performed in Toronto as part of FADO’s emerging artist series “11:45”.",Firstly_COMMA_ for the past year I have been considering the performative situation_COMMA_ as one in which there is a perpetual reversal of power and vulnerability reciprocating between the audience and myself/the performer. I like to create situations where these empowered/vulnerable positions get thrown back and forth like a hot potato. In this way_COMMA_ opposites inform each other while equal meaning and value is ascribed to both. I need my audience and often ask them to participate by singing me songs_COMMA_ or closing their eyes while I make costume changes_COMMA_ reading the letters I give them_COMMA_ and letting me draw them. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Also_COMMA_ I would say that my decision making process often depends on testing things out on peers and friends. I like to know how they respond to visual_COMMA_ textual and gestural ideas because I feel like potential meaning is collaboration. It could never be my doing alone. Meaning is created out of the collective experience of something. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Finally_COMMA_ I work in close collaboration with the members of WIVES collective_COMMA_ to make experimental theatre and live and video performance. When we perform together we are one. It is quite indescribable but I will say that this state it is enabled by a certain quality in me wherein I allow myself to be lost completely into someone else.,https://vimeo.com/63187000_NEWLINE_This video_COMMA_ titled “yes”_COMMA_ features a mirrored image of myself committing the repetitive gesture of slapping my own face. The gesture seems violent at first but through repetition attains a certain ambiguity and meditative or therapeutic quality. This image is accompanied by subtitled dialogue between the identical images. The two selves both ignore each other’s statements and finish each other’s sentences. The “conversation” is rendered into an elucidation of something unspoken. There is no specificity_COMMA_ only sentimentality. I am talking both to myself and to someone not present. For me this work responds very specifically to the School of Making thinking’s summer residency on UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING because for me it occupies a space that I will potentially never understand. I am thinking but it is not yet a thought in a way that the thought may be a thing and furthermore in the way that a thing-thought might be understood. For me linking a gesture or movement disembodies the text. In a sense it disallows the text from attaining any finite or concrete meaning. It this way it proposes something entirely outside our thoughts. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_https://vimeo.com/81539404 _NEWLINE_This is a video documentation of installment 7 of my performance series called “i feel sick”. It was performed outside the AGO in downtown Toronto as part NXNE ART in June of 2013. I’m selecting this work to include in my application because I feel it represents how I offer my gestures to others/the public in a way the gives them lots of space. I am definitely present yet unimposing. This signifies to me moreover_COMMA_ a certain kind of calm reflection I do through action and in dialogue with others.,In 2010 I moved to Guatemala to work with adventure tourism project. During this time the project (made up of myself _COMMA_another leader and 3-5 participants) would spend half the week_COMMA_ for 8 weeks in the highland cloud forests where we would hike up to a camp with all our food and sleep in tree houses. Every morning I would teach yoga to everyone. We cooked all of our meals over that fire and hiked to water spring for our water. The project would then spend the other half of the week in a village where I would coordinate volunteer programs to teach art and English to children._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_In 2012 I moved to Joshua Tree_COMMA_ California with my partner who was working on a earth dome building project. There I cooked meals for the 6 builders. My partner and I slept in one of the 3 small ‘pod’ domes on the site. In all we were 7 people living on a 2-acre plot of land_COMMA_ sleeping in a combination of domes trailers and tents. We had electricity for a small part of the day when we turn the generator on.,My keenest interest in the session theme is in the application of philosophy to somatics in a creative structure. One of the goals of my practice is to find a quality or type of movement/gesture that is embodiment of it’s own meaning; movement that does not create meaning through representation. I am interested in creating movement that moves freely through the entirety of the body but is still actively ‘real’ and in so responsible to the situation around it. I imagine a readable pedestrian gesture that gets swallowed by a dance vacuum. My intuition tells me that a way towards this is through creating a unique logic that responds to a specific mind/body inquiry –such as “how can we think what we don’t know how to think?” Likewise_COMMA_ the question could be changed to “how can we act/move/gest what we don’t know how to think?” That being said I think the topic of the residency is absolutely appropriate to help me direct myself towards this particular creative objective of mine._NEWLINE_On another note_COMMA_ I feel my practice would benefit tremendously from the open and communal structures of the residency. When I create a performance it is often for a particular context_COMMA_ with a particular audience in mind. It is very seldom that my creative impulses arise solely out of themselves and have space to develop organically. I often feel like I am making a show and I would like to_COMMA_ during the course of the residency_COMMA_ explore questions instead.,,Given UNLIMITED FUNDING_COMMA_ I would build a large glass pyramid in a field. The pyramid would be large enough to house about 10 people. In this rectangle these people would be executing a choreography of independent and partnered gesture_COMMA_ centered on the task of putting thumbtacks in balloons and blowing the balloons up. Culminating into an endurance performance_COMMA_ the performers would fill the balloons until the space is full from floor to ceiling. Some of the movement involved in this performance puts the balloons at risk of popping –especially if they blown up to maximum capacity. There would be a live recording of the space that would be broadcasted to the outside but re-mixed in via programming to play in super slow motion. I would install cameras inside the space (gopro cameras maybe?) and would later edit the performance footage into a video_COMMA_ in such a way that a narrative might be suggested between the performers and the space.,Q: How can we negotiate a fragmented mental/psychological/intellectual experience with a healthy body? _NEWLINE_A: Creative meditation methods that do not idealize perfection.,none.,Through a few friends who have also participated: Morgan Sea and Adriana Disman.,I do not eat pork or chicken. I am allergic to random things like bananas and almonds. These are not life threatning allergies however_COMMA_ just intolerances.
3/1/2014 18:12:42,Alisha,Mascarenhas,paper.raincloud@gmail.com,514-488-1129,paper.raincloud@gmail.com,Canada,Montréal,6/24/1989,poetryandbreakfast.wordpress.com,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o_a0-q4EhDquigCE1YOzt0nMDqeJ4-t5-EKZmN8o26c/pub,Session A (BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE // RECONSTRUCTING WILDNESS),I am fascinated with the body as a site of infinite wisdom and a living archive of experience. Whether in stillness or in movement_COMMA_ the body is the most accessible_COMMA_ intimate and tender medium through which I learn. Lately_COMMA_ I have been learning through a desire to embrace some of the tensions and contradictions (felt most viscerally in the body) between the wild and expansive nature of the imagination and the material realities_COMMA_ histories and political context within which I find myself. I am currently exploring ways of using these tensions as a means for creative resistance and transformation. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_In tandem with this curiosity around tension comes my attraction to language as a medium of expression_COMMA_ learning_COMMA_ healing and growth. I love the process of pressing up against the rigidity and limitations of words; the release within a structure. I love investigating_COMMA_ disassembling and unraveling words_COMMA_ and delight in watching them form on a page or tumble out of our mouths as if of their own volition. I love feeling contained by language_COMMA_ and using that container as a catalyst for discovery.,Whether I work alone or in direct collaboration with others_COMMA_ I understand the entire creative process as inherently collaborative. Every element_COMMA_ every image and idea is somehow informed by_COMMA_ and infused with_COMMA_ the infinite sources of inspiration that emerge from everything around me that is alive: the people_COMMA_ insects_COMMA_ trees and sunlight. Beyond inspiration_COMMA_ I am joyfully indebted to the constructive criticisms and feedback from those with whom I share my practice. This is instrumental in keeping my work authentic and alive._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_There is also the magic that I experience during moments of collective presence in performance. I treat my role as a performer as one which cultivates a space of presence_COMMA_ establishing contact and provoking invitation into the realm or reality created in the performance space. So I see the generative process of creation as well as its product as constantly collaborative.,One of the more recent tangible manifestations of things I have been feeling/thinking that relate to the SMT_COMMA_ and especially the “Between Nature & Culture” theme_COMMA_ is the research_COMMA_ writing and exploratory exchange I have undertaken since last Fall. This is centered in learning through a few Indigenous women’s writing of prose and poetry as a means of sensitizing ourselves to the connections between the body and land. This work emerged out of a course I took on Indigenous Traditions_COMMA_ Women & Colonialism_COMMA_ and continues to spiral out in various forms of research_COMMA_ writing_COMMA_ and embodied experience. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_This project has served an ongoing process of experimentation with the use of language as a tool of invitation into experiential learning. In this way_COMMA_ I have been exploring and sharing how words can work both to maintain as well as subvert colonial ways of thinking and being. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_So far_COMMA_ this project has taken the form of a paper entitled “Beyond a Fear of the Wild: Reading Indigenous Women’s Writing on Body & Land”_COMMA_ which I will share on a panel on Indigenous Women and Resistance as part of Concordia University’s “Study in Action” conference in March 2014. It has also expressed itself through in a week spent in meditation and observation under a tree in Oaxaca_COMMA_ Mexico_COMMA_ as well as in my poetry practice. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_*In lieu of providing links_COMMA_ here is the abstract of the paper I am referring to_COMMA_ if you are interested:_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_This paper is an invitation to awareness. It emerges from a framework that considers historically masculinist_COMMA_ colonial worldviews as contributing to an ongoing culture of violence_COMMA_ and understands decolonization as a gradual and ongoing process. In sharing this work I will begin by briefly bringing forth a couple of documented examples of the disconnect between body and land to shine a little light on some of the language used for the purposes of the colonial project. Next_COMMA_ I will show how some Indigenous women are resisting and destabilizing colonial beliefs through teachings centered on the interdependent relationship between the body and the land. As a process and living practice of unlearning colonial worldviews cannot truly manifest through book reading alone_COMMA_ these teachings act as an invitation to an embodied process of un-learning; developing a sensitivity to the dynamic exchange between body and land. Their work asks us to consider how we relate to the land_COMMA_ and the material_COMMA_ psychological and spiritual implications of such a relationship. I aim to show how learning through these writings can contribute to a process of sensitizing ourselves to our environment_COMMA_ facilitating a moving away from colonial worldviews and towards communion with the land through a relationship of reverence and respect.,Communal living has taken several forms at different moments in my life_COMMA_ and right now it is through a shared living space in Montréal with three humans and two furry creatures. We share bulk dry goods and recuperate fruits and veggies_COMMA_ make kombucha and communal meals when we can. We share hand harvested honey_COMMA_ reading materials and plenty of nourishing kitchen floor conversation_COMMA_ and have developed several functional systems for division of labour_COMMA_ as well as financial and material contributions. We have a compost system using vermi-compost in the house and bringing organic waste to the collective garden that some of us work at during the growing season. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Every week we hold a meditation and listening circle where we light a candle and sit in silence_COMMA_ followed by a check-in_COMMA_ and sometimes experimental singing_COMMA_ playing or fort-building. We also have a small stuffed spotted owl who we take turns hiding around the house to develop observation skills and awareness of space.,I have been hungering for the space_COMMA_ time and support to synthesize these seemingly separate practices of yoga asana_COMMA_ meditation_COMMA_ poetry_COMMA_ academic research and writing_COMMA_ and performance. The nature of this course is so closely in line with the work I have been doing that I got this incredible rush all through my spine just reading the description! _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I feel that I will deeply benefit from the exploration of narrative through story telling_COMMA_ as this is central to my work and life_COMMA_ from the body-centric learning that I know can happen through slow play_COMMA_ and the insights and sparks that performed discussion can ignite. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I feel a deep need for the space and collaborative support that this residency has the potential to bring_COMMA_ as well as some time to sit_COMMA_ run and play in the woods/grass/dirt/wind. It is the learning that comes through awakened receptivity to the messages of the body and land_COMMA_ and that exhilarating tension between form and freedom found in intentionally creative_COMMA_ collective space that I seek. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The aspect of “wildness” is of special intrigue to me_COMMA_ particularly with a consciousness of the dominant and colonially constructed division between the body and mind; rational and irrational; masculine and feminine; civilized and savage. I have been finding myself experiencing small flashes of insight in the readings_COMMA_ discussions and thinking I have been doing about this_COMMA_ and see immense potential for deepening_COMMA_ complicating and expanding that learning through this residency session. As my creative practice is a necessary element in all of my learning_COMMA_ I also recognize potential for a more seamless integration between this practice and my more formal academic explorations.,(Only applying to Session A),Session A: Between Nature & Culture_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I would love to create a performance that uses the language and sound of poetry to generate embodied movement. Through this_COMMA_ I wish to bring full_COMMA_ living expression to my poems as living entities occurring always in a particular context with a particular group of people. The process of writing_COMMA_ speaking and sharing poetry has always emerged through my body_COMMA_ yet has not come into full expression in performance; meanwhile_COMMA_ the body-centered work and play I have done has often lacked the tangible synthesis of language. My sense is that I have less a need for money or material resources as much as the intentional space and support to more fully realize this merging of creative practices. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I do not have specifics in mind yet_COMMA_ but envision a series of poems_COMMA_ either new or re-visited_COMMA_ performed in an embodied_COMMA_ gestured manner_COMMA_ and in dialogue with those present. My understanding of such dialogue implies direct contact between “performer” and “spectator”; the holding of space and guiding of a narrative arc that facilitates collective release. What I mean by release involves a connection to the breath and a relaxing of the diaphragm_COMMA_ and happens at the moment in the performance when everyone is together at the same time- often through a shared exhale or laughter.,Q: What can you offer to a collective learning process?_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_A: Through training and experience as a yoga teacher_COMMA_ educator and workshop facilitator have allowed me to develop a strong capacity to hold space and actively support individuals’ particular experiences. I have come to recognize an ability to facilitate this process while allowing full agency and autonomy of the person I aim to support.,I don't foresee any scheduling conflicts as I intend to commit to the full three weeks_COMMA_ even if this will mean not participating in other opportunities.,From my dear friend Adriana Disman and attending the Brooklyn fundraiser in February!,I prefer not to eat most meat_COMMA_ and have no allergies.

Photography is my primary medium but I also work with video_COMMA_ sound and sculpture. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_My work is driven by an enthusiasm for small or mundane details in the world around me that are overlooked by others_COMMA_ hence my fascination with dust. Dust is all around us and all things become dust. Some of its largest components are human skin and hair_COMMA_ though it contains other surprising materials like star dust. (For more information on my dust project have a look here at my website here: www.sallybozzuto.com/#!dust/cyuu)_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I'm also fascinated with things that fit into the following categories: terrifying_COMMA_ gross_COMMA_ amazing. For example: teeth. Teeth are a part of one's skeleton that is seen on the outside of the body (terrifying)_COMMA_ they are covered in bacteria and saliva (gross) but they are also necessary for our survival (amazing.) With the exception of nanomachines picking our bodies apart molecule by molecule (grey goo) or maybe marshmallow fluff I think most of the things I can think of that fit into The Grand Three categories are biological in nature: babies_COMMA_ bacteria_COMMA_ dirt_COMMA_ carniverous plants_COMMA_ etc. Most things about the human body fit into The Grand Three if you think about them for long enough. The human body and its relation to the larger life cycle is one of the key elements of some of my newest work._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I am also an excellent conversationalist and have an absurd love of puns. Some of my most recent pun work includes my idea for this year's Halloween costume: a narwhal-mart greeter. Think: smiley face logo with a tusk and fins.,As a photographer and videographer I am always collaborating with others. This takes on many forms: brainstorming sketches and ideas for a project with other artists_COMMA_ interacting with models or subjects_COMMA_ getting feedback on works in progress or working with a crew_COMMA_ especially in the case of video-making. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I think one of the great advantages of working in a residency setting is to get feedback from other artists and thinkers and to have exciting conversation that can spark new ideas. I especially love talking to artists working in different media or people with expertise in other areas such as writing_COMMA_ philosophy_COMMA_ science etc. I think dialogue is one of the most precious and important elements of the art-making process.,http://www.sallybozzuto.com/#!hcybaygos/c1n0f_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_How Can You Be Alive You Growths of Spring? addresses regenerative cycles of life and death using substances such as dust_COMMA_ compost_COMMA_ the human body and plant life. This work stems from a fascination with the complexities of biology and wonder at the improbability of life generating and regenerating itself in endless cycles._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Using photography and video I document real and staged processes such as bodily refuse mixing with decaying vegetation to create compost or plants growing from unlikely sources._NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_My work toes the line of attraction and repulsion by showing things such as death_COMMA_ decay_COMMA_ and bodily refuse in an aesthetically appealing way. I am also addressing the relation of seemingly contradictory forces. Decay begets new growth_COMMA_ birth begets death and death begets rebirth. The cycle is terrifying_COMMA_ repulsive and amazing all at once. It is my hope that this work fills the viewer with a sense of wonder at the incredible regenerative nature of life and stimulates deeper contemplation of both life and death on a larger scale as part of an endless_COMMA_ cosmic cycle.,I attended SMT for the past two summers and have lived happily with many different roommates. I also have experience living at summer camp and band camp as a young person.,"Nature is the primary theme in my newest work_COMMA_ How Can You Be Alive You Growths of Spring?_COMMA_ so the theme ""Between Nature and Culture/Reconstructing Wildness"" is extremely relevant to my practice._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I am very excited to engage in discussions on topics regarding ""The Wild_COMMA_"" what that means and if there even is such a thing. The aspects of culture surrounding The Wild are of particular interest to me as I think this is something that could be explored much more in my work.

My life has been filled with adversity and isolation_COMMA_ so I consider dreams_COMMA_ fears and anxiety to be extremely valuable parts of human experience. Much of my belief system has developed through a continuous dialogue with a sister who shares my DNA but not all of my experiences. My work and interests are easily traced to the use of this dialogue as a tool for measuring the validity and value of our adverse experiences and emotions in regards to survival within society. I do not believe adverse experiences should be treated as invaluable and often I feel there is an attempt to eradicate them along with a skeptical dialogue of our culture in education. I have a B.A. in Art Education and teaching certification from Meredith College and an M.F.A. from the New York Academy of Art. I have recently completed an experimental animation that is off to compete in film festivals. This work incorporates a life-size_COMMA_ partially animatronic_COMMA_ low-budget_COMMA_ stop-motion puppet as well as other puppets and drawings. Having just finished my most ambitious animation to date_COMMA_ I am currently teaching at a public school in Raleigh_COMMA_ North Carolina and pursuing funding and opportunities to take my animation and kinetic work to the next level. I have a two-month-long gallery show at the end of this year that will incorporate animations_COMMA_ puppets_COMMA_ kinetic sculpture_COMMA_ drawings and music. My work is surreal_COMMA_ psychological and attempts to capture beauty and value in adversity_COMMA_ isolation_COMMA_ and venturing into dark places without remaining trapped in them.,The way in which I have always lived my life and created artwork seems to be therapeutically and spiritually connected to my survival and this can also be said of the people to whom I become close. Because of the isolation that I experienced growing up_COMMA_ it became imperative to think outside of “reality” in order to survive. This has both positive and negative aspects when trying to keep this quality and participate in community and society_COMMA_ but it does require the seeking out of companions who function this way as well and there is some magic in it. I have always created art in intellectual gatherings of friends_COMMA_ and past dialogues and dreams have led to my current work and goals. In my animating_COMMA_ I am literally working with others and must access my relationship resources in order to complete them. My most recent film incorporated live actors who acted in stop-motion with my life-size_COMMA_ Frankenstein influenced_COMMA_ self-portrait. My upcoming show will incorporate the help_COMMA_ art_COMMA_ music_COMMA_ support and input of dozens of people. I find that along with the experiences of my twin sister_COMMA_ I am often trying to pull from the experiences of others to find overarching themes that hopefully lead to modern_COMMA_ visual mythologies and enhance the spiritual value of my life and the lives of others.,Please watch my most recent animation at: https://vimeo.com/81851033 The password is: psycho_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Also_COMMA_ please look at my website._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Recently_COMMA_ I have spent a lot of time reading_COMMA_ researching and thinking about identity_COMMA_ the idea of the individual_COMMA_ epigenetics_COMMA_ nature and nature_COMMA_ the work of Charlie Kaufman_COMMA_ the philosophies of Ludwig Wittgenstein_COMMA_ the problems of technological determinism_COMMA_ and twin symbolism in art.,All but one of my living situations have been communal.

I struggle always to find something that matches that relationship_COMMA_ but I know I never will.,"""How can we think what we do not know how to think?"" is a question that creates probably one of my favorite black holes to fall into_COMMA_ and I feel it is a deep thought spiral that is related to all the thoughts in my brain_COMMA_ feeling often outside of myself and separated from reality_COMMA_ not ever knowing when I am thinking like ""myself"" or how much control I have over what that is. Because of this_COMMA_ I love dreams_COMMA_ all talk of them and looking for synchronicities between my life and the lives of others.

The viewer is changed from viewer to participant and even an active plot driver. The object is changed from passive subject of observation to a complex character. In this way the hierarchical barrier between viewer and object falls away_COMMA_ activating both the viewer and the object as characters of equal force. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The narrative happens episodically_COMMA_ with main characters who appear as puppets or dolls. Rather than existing on a stage or inhabiting a fictional plane_COMMA_ the puppets inhabit the real world: getting haircuts_COMMA_ writing notes to human acquaintances_COMMA_ dying and being interred_COMMA_ or inciting a grave digging. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Events unfold organically and genuinely_COMMA_ and I as the artist often take on the role of character rather than master puppeteer. The lack of total control serves to tint the unfolding events with honesty. It reminds us that though what is happening in these pieces is the language of the lunatic or the trickster (a part of the mind may choose to hang back an laugh at the absurdity of accusing a puppet of a crime)_COMMA_ it is at its core as real as the human experience. Fellow human characters participating in these events observe how they feel compelled by the circumstances_COMMA_ and even by the puppet characters_COMMA_ to feel and react in a way that is surprising_COMMA_ unplanned_COMMA_ and genuine. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_These “circumstances” are a part of a larger_COMMA_ perhaps interminable epic. They are an intuitive narrative that asks questions about the agency of objects_COMMA_ the authenticity of intuition_COMMA_ the human condition as character in play_COMMA_ manipulation and perception_COMMA_ and the defining qualities of what is real.,My main practice is at it's core dependent on collaboration. The circumstances defy the separations that traditionally exist between reality and fiction_COMMA_ artist and viewer_COMMA_ art work and real world. Much of what the work becomes is due to its existence in the mind of the participants. They act not as viewers of an object_COMMA_ but actants in a series of events. Thus my work is arguably always a collaboration. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Aside from my core artistic practice_COMMA_ I also participate frequently in collaborative efforts_COMMA_ such as event planning_COMMA_ group exhibition curation_COMMA_ and collaborative art projects. Most recently I completed an artist book_COMMA_ designed_COMMA_ illustrated_COMMA_ and crafted collaboratively with artist Mike Calway-Fagen. I am currently organizing a puppet slam_COMMA_ for which I've invited a number of individuals from various artistic backgrounds_COMMA_ as well as non-artists_COMMA_ including scientists and environmental activists. These creative minds are coming together to both invent and produce an alternative puppet performance that will challenge given power dynamics_COMMA_ starting with expectations about puppetry. In this way_COMMA_ the work will both directly and indirectly challenge far reaching and basic assumptions about the human place in the universe.,The circumstances surrounding Fabro's Funeral represent two separate situations_COMMA_ each of which were a part of an ongoing epic. This work involves a dependency on the voluntary participation of others_COMMA_ a perpetual call and response between the people and objects involved_COMMA_ and the importance of moment to moment involvement. It also embodied a search-based approach to content_COMMA_ and revealed a richness of substance as events unfolded. The piece is not preserved in crisp documentary photographs_COMMA_ but in snapshots_COMMA_ and in the minds of the participants involved. In this way it is both un-preservable and ongoing_COMMA_ embodying the spontaneity of hear-say. The piece involved questions about life and death_COMMA_ reality and spectacle_COMMA_ and humor and sincerity_COMMA_ but,I have lived on an organic farm under a work-trade agreement. During that time I exchanged 15 hours a week of farm labor for living space in the farm house. I became personal friends with the entrepreneurial farmer who initiated the project. I have also lived with 2 or more room-mates while living and working through school. Each living arrangement has focused on community building_COMMA_ including cooperative cooking and meal-sharing. During my time in Bloomington I have had a close association with the Bloomington Cooperative Living community_COMMA_ and have hosted events for the benefit of the living community as well as participating in the meal-share program.,My work has become increasingly interested in challenging accepted power-dynamics and structures. This manifests primarily in the process of work making rather than the content of the work itself. The art-making process begins with impulse and through a self-aware openness (or perhaps relinquishing of self) discovers the subconscious richness of events. This seems to be consistent with the mission statement of the School of Making Thinking_COMMA_ and I am happy to have found an establishment that claims heurism as it's central maxim. It is because of this self-same center that I have applied to all three programs_COMMA_ but with a special interest in Unthinking/Unknowing_COMMA_ which seems to speak to the heart of my work most directly_COMMA_ but also seems to be applicable to a broader practice outside of the residency program.,"My work is centrally interested in allowing the spontaneous to unfold_COMMA_ which is one of the integral focuses of the hike. I'm also very interested in non-homocentric perspectives--that is to say_COMMA_ the investigation of the universe that does not place the human at it's center. Ideally I'd like to craft an experience to take place during the hike that allows this perspective to be fully experienced. This may focus on the environmentalist value of ""bio-centrism""_COMMA_ but it may also be related to the broader view of ""selflessness"" in its most deconstructed and broadly applicable form.",I have up to this point enjoyed drawing from an attitude of resourcefulness_COMMA_ relying on the appropriation of cast-off and discarded items. I find that this practice brings charged objects to the work; objects that carry their history and character with them. This is almost stubbornly low-cost at times. Given unlimited funding_COMMA_ I think I may still choose to work in this way_COMMA_ re-using items that are obtained without cost as a rule. Funding_COMMA_ however_COMMA_ could be utilized in this situation for transportation of items typically more difficult to obtain. This might create an interesting opportunity to engage and examine the process of transport in all it's dimensions: its economics_COMMA_ it's environmental impact_COMMA_ and it's effect upon us as objects in a constantly shifting world.,What is the usefulness of a question? Maybe the usefulness of a question is not as a formulaic approach to the acquisition of understanding or a fortification of a belief system. Rather_COMMA_ the value of a question is the experience it offers: a question is an acknowledgment of doubt. To acknowledge doubt with no hurry to resolve it is to embrace uncertainty_COMMA_ even to invite it as an artistic medium.,I do not at this time have any scheduling conflicts.

I am currently negotiating what it means to be an artist who expresses through the medium of exploration_COMMA_ and how to create work for presentation via exploration.,I am drawn to The School of Making Thinking because of its approach to collaborative work. As an emerging artist_COMMA_ I find sharing ideas extremely intimidating. I’m easily embarrassed and I often sell myself short because of it. After reading SMT’s ideas on collaboration/individuation_COMMA_ I am convinced that it’s within this community structure I will find my ideal form of collaboration that will allow me to break from being self conscious_COMMA_ and instead learn to embrace the vulnerability that comes with allowing your ideas to move from mind to mind. I am motivated by group discussion_COMMA_ and glean insight for my own projects while observing peers critique each other. When working in a group on one project_COMMA_ I sway more to the side of a follower than a leader if the final product is going to be something that requires interpretation_COMMA_ however_COMMA_ if the project is something literal I feel more comfortable being vocal with my opinions. I believe this is rooted in the insecurity of not believing in myself as an artist_COMMA_ and my struggle of self-identifying as one.,At one point in my life I thought I was going to be the first person I knew personally to go into space. A popular daily paper promised to send someone to space - all you had to do was ask and get the most votes. I thought if I made a video to accompany my request I’d be chosen for sure. I was not. That said_COMMA_ I still plan on being in space at some point in my life. I wouldn’t describe this as the work that represents me best in relation to being fit for the SMT program_COMMA_ but it showcases my enthusiasm and ernest disposition when working on projects that excite me. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAggD8qoi4I_NEWLINE_A work in forever progress that is more aligned with the SMT program is Rambler_COMMA_ currently a blog with zine ambitions that I post long winded stories and photos from adventures.

Before setting sail_COMMA_ we spent a week on land living together. We made meals_COMMA_ shared our fears_COMMA_ and on the final night we sat in a sauna taking ten deep breaths as a group then jumped into the Atlantic as one. At sea we were all accountable for each other’s life.,I believe that Between Nature and Culture// Reconstructing Wildness is a program that given the opportunity_COMMA_ would remedy my dilemma of the artist vs. explorer struggle. The focus on group work is an element that I know is missing in my current practice_COMMA_ and with the aid and critique of others in a safe zone for sharing_COMMA_ I will be able to let go of many self-doubts that hold me back from currently making the work I conceive. _NEWLINE_The session Unthinking/Unknowing is something that on a basic level I have been trying to achieve since I left school. It’s something that I think everyone should be working on_COMMA_ but it’s difficult to know where to start. For myself_COMMA_ and I believe it’s this way for a lot of people_COMMA_ the idea comes as a feeling_COMMA_ then the unthought-thought comes to the surface_COMMA_ and from there without instruction_COMMA_ it has no where to go and I’m back to thinking what I am told to think. _NEWLINE_Challenging oneself to formulate ideas and concepts through more unfamiliar territories_COMMA_ such as intuition and unconventional learning allows for one to develop new modes of thinking_COMMA_ and expand their creative process within their own work.,During the “Summit on a Summit” hike I would like to lead a workshop in telling time (during sunlight) and direction (at night) by natural indicators. I’d like to explore as a group the dichotomy of a sunrise_COMMA_ vs. a numerical time of day_COMMA_ or the position of the stars vs. a number value or name for a direction. These are both man-made structures that it’s difficult to imagine life without_COMMA_ however the natural world is existing without these things. I want to have a discussion about what this means; to comply with something man invented_COMMA_ in this case time as a number_COMMA_ but to know that it even with this system in place_COMMA_ the phenomenon of a sunset knows no time_COMMA_ and is existing regardless of what time your clock says. Man’s invention of time_COMMA_ vs. the Earths rotation around the Sun happen simultaneously_COMMA_ I think there’s a lot that can come from this observation_COMMA_ especially on a hike_COMMA_ and the romanticisms of losing track of time and direction.,With unlimited funding_COMMA_ I would create a space that would serve as a site-specific Museum of Natural Imagined History. The project’s intention is to challenge fact vs. fiction in nature and promote discussion on what the general public is willing to accept as scientific truths or myths. Often we cite what’s published as truth without question_COMMA_ but sometimes after years of further examination_COMMA_ we find these truths of the past become modern-day myths. I often find the myth is more alluring than the fact_COMMA_ and as an artist I’d like to explore this idea further and ask the participants to immerse themselves in a world that is based less on scientific “theory”_COMMA_ and more on the Ancient Greek word “theoria”_COMMA_ which means “a looking at_COMMA_ viewing_COMMA_ beholding”.,If asked by Mars One to be one of the 24 explorers sent on a one-way mission to colonize Mars_COMMA_ would you go?_NEWLINE_Funny you ask; that question’s been on my mind.

3/2/2014 3:35:29,Lasha,Mowchun,lashamowchun@gmail.com,2049967493,lashamowchun@gmail.com,Canada,Winnipeg,6/30/1989,http://vimeo.com/user6901463,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hyT6OZxQNljKIKVdBMdAhNJxZNtgwmXu16BDjc2F0Hs/edit,Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING),My name is Lasha Mowchun and I would position myself as equally thinker and artist. I wanted to be an artist from the time that I was very very young and thought that I would be a painter. After several unsatisfied years as a painter I found myself looking at my paintings and wanting them to move_COMMA_ to speak. I felt frustrated with the silence and stasis of the gallery experience. I felt critical of Fine Art more broadly_COMMA_ because I felt that it was often inaccessible to the broader population and that the institutional galleries reproduced the marginalizations which were in broader society. I wanted art to be something which was not confined to the gallery_COMMA_ which was able to reach out and uplift pieces of society which were not within the art world. My frustrations almost entirely dissuaded me from realizing my childhood dream of being an artist. Instead of giving up I tried to put my criticisms to work in a productive way. I began to theorize relational aesthetics and participatory art as a way of breaking the divide between audience and artist. I became interested in film because it is a media which has permeated deeply into both high and low culture and which is therefore available to a broader audience. I use my camera not only to fuse narrative and aesthetic concerns but to respond to social inequalities and philosophical questions. After many years of making films_COMMA_ I do not believe that I will ever completely answer my questions of institutional power_COMMA_ hierarchy and populism through my media. Instead I do not look for answers but seek to remain sensitive and open. I try to let my questions continually to reformulate themselves which forces me to reformulate my media and aesthetics to respond. Giving up painting was important for me because it taught me that being open to change allows opportunities for unexpected transformation.,I think that people are not the authors of their own thoughts because our sentiments are the furnishings of broader ideological forces. In this manner all thought is collaborative_COMMA_ because meaning is created within a web which extends beyond the individual. In my practice as a filmmaker I see my camera as a relational entity within which this ideology has been inscribed. _NEWLINE_I believe that filmic works whether artistic or commercial exist in a dialogue with the broader ideological forces because film is a mass artform_COMMA_ which serves not only to entertain but also to control_COMMA_ to govern and to design our representations. I am interested in responding to these ideologies_COMMA_ whether they be consumeristic_COMMA_ political or social within the medium of film because I see it as a site specific interrogation. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The practice of making a film is inherently collaborative as it is created by many individuals in a network. As a filmmaker I have had to reach out to many communities I was previously unfamiliar with. In advertising for actors on the internet_COMMA_ meeting crew members who are willing to work for free_COMMA_ or in exchange for my work on their project I have extended beyond myself. The subjectivities of these many collaborators are then integrated into the content of the project itself extending the ideological references beyond those which I have personalized._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_ Particularly through my use of non-actors in dramatic roles I have found that identity is not an expression of self_COMMA_ but a performance of ideology. Someone who is not a trained actor has not learned to unpack their concepts of self and when they play a character they surface. I want to access these surfacings because they are the runoff of glacial beliefs systems which mould the individual. As someone who has acted in my own films_COMMA_ or had my close personal relationships translated into narrative I have been fascinated to watch the strange formations of ideology surface. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Collaboration has been essential to my art practice because I think that my work is more relevant if it is challenged by forces which are beyond my personal sentiments. I have written many of my projects in direct collaboration with other artists and invited strangers into my editing suites. I like collaboration not only because of its philosophical qualities_COMMA_ but also because I like to feel stimulated and challenged by other people.,I am applying for the Unthinking/Unknowing seminar between July 1st and 21st because I am interested in questioning my preconceptions_COMMA_ working in collaboration and ultimately approaching thinking as concept. As an example of my relevant work I will provide my most recent film_COMMA_ entitled the Excruciating Beauty of Melody which considers irrationalism as a form of anti-knowledge through we may gain clearer insight. I would like to provide a link to the film and recommend that because the film is 25 minutes long_COMMA_ if the jury only has a limited time they watch from 18:00 forward. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_http://vimeo.com/73748392_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Inspired from a real delusion_COMMA_ the film follows the life of a young man who believes that his body is becoming a musical instrument. The score is of the film is his personal soundtrack- a piano which begins to haunt him_COMMA_ at first from the distance and then moving closer_COMMA_ until it is inside of him. This film was loosely based on a story from my family which has been told and retold_COMMA_ detailing a schizophrenic episode which my Uncle Elroy in which he believed that he could play the piano on his teeth. I had been fascinated with this story for years and as I came of age as an artist and feminist particular themes in this story began to interest me. The music which Elroy heard_COMMA_ elicited from his body seemed to be a unique way of knowing the body which is outside of the confines of gender. I believe that sexuality has been narrowed through the binary system of gender_COMMA_ which covers over the hidden meanings of the body and narrows the pluralities of identity. My Uncle Elroy had a girlfriend named Laura during his formative experience with schizophrenia whom he still talks about today_COMMA_ 40 years later. I sought to portray this music as a form of anti-knowledge_COMMA_ which helped both Laura and Elroy efface their gendered knowledge of their bodies and move into a unknown place in which they might allow the hidden meaning of their bodies to surface.,I currently live in communal housing with two other artists. Together we share a house which was built in 1895 around the time which my hometown of Winnipeg_COMMA_ Canada was being settled. I find our home to be a source of personal nourishment and inspiration. Together we form a micro-community which connects to a larger constellation of art_COMMA_ thought and radicalism in the city of Winnipeg. In the past I have had communal living experiences through living on intentional communities in both California and Oregon. Both of these communities were on eco-farms where the community grew and harvested their own food.,I am applying to the Unthinking/Unknowing residency because on a fundamental level my art is fed by theoretical practice and I am interested in exploring this from the standpoint of a critical pedagogy. I am interested in Deleuze’s concept that thinking is an exercise which demands that one create a place of unknowing in which unexpected discourses may arise. It makes sense to me that unknowing itself would be the basis for thinking because I believe that the sentiments of an individual are often the furnishings of a wider ideology. These sentiments themselves do not necessarily constitute thinking. I think that one must become self conscious of this ideology in order to make contact with the realm of thought.. Reading and writing are by big parts of my practice as an artist_COMMA_ but I know that there are different ways to know things which transcends these modes. I feel that art should be more integrated into daily life_COMMA_ including our personal behaviours and daily relationships.This workshop provides an opportunity for participants to reconfigure knowledge into more foundational areas of our lives including our relationships to ourselves and to one another.,,In the past I have used the technique of casting to create a form of sculpture which combines figurative sculpture_COMMA_ with burning wax and digital projection. I know that this seems difficult to envision so please consult the following link. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_http://vimeo.com/46888685_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_To create this sculpture I poured wax into a cast which was taken from my head. I then inserted a wick into the hot wax_COMMA_ giving my head a certain mortality as the burning wick of the candle melts away the wax. I then projected a video of myself onto the candle creating an overlapping of representations. This is a lengthy and expensive process. If I had unlimited funding I would hire studio assistants_COMMA_ buy lots of wax_COMMA_ casting materials and additional video projectors._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_At the School of Making Thinking I would use these materials and labour to make casts from other participants who volunteer themselves. I would cast from different parts of the body on each participant and combine the casts into a singular body_COMMA_ creating a collage of many bodies together. The inspirations for this body would be taken from the somatic techniques of Roberto Freire which seek use group movement in therapy. I would broadcast projections onto this wax sculpture of participants who volunteered to have their reflections on the the somatic therapy filmed. This sculpture would be a body which transcends the individual and embodies knowledge in its collaborative form.,What do you draw your inspiration from?_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_As a writer and filmmaker my narrative are inspired listening and paying attention to dialogue around me. I am always gathering research from people in my midst and carefully observing. I have been known to tape record my family suppers to glean narratives from convoluted stories and manias.,I currently do not have any schedule conflicts.,Residencies Unlimited,I do not eat meat

I am currently writing a book about my narrative theories_COMMA_ called "" The Neurotic's Journey""_COMMA_ which posits_COMMA_ among many other ideas_COMMA_ that late 20th century and early 21st century cinema differs from earlier filmic forms in that it offers both a more fragmented and conflicted inner landscape in a radically intimate character subjectivity_COMMA_ and a more collective and transcendent outer landscape in mythical and mystical catharsis_COMMA_ which transcends human identity_COMMA_ space_COMMA_ and time. In this way for me today’s cinema is at once going in deeper and pushing out farther_COMMA_ at play with Deluze’s notion of cinema as crystal_COMMA_ Tarkovsky’s concepts of time and transcendence_COMMA_ Jodorwsky's Psychomagic_COMMA_ Jung’s collective unconscious_COMMA_ the notions of capitalism and patriarchy as inherently alienating_COMMA_ Kristeva's abject/eruptive female and Ponty’s exploration of the body as experience. In addition to the book_COMMA_ I am working on my screenplay_COMMA_ Hearbeat_COMMA_ a psychological thriller about a girl who gets a heart transplant from her dad's lover. _NEWLINE_I also do psychic journeying and energy work. I am starting an informal energy work collective with my like-minded friends. I did not study this or seek this out_COMMA_ it came to me in series of experiences that opened me into a very healing field of unknowing. Everything I do has come from a 'not knowing'.",I co- produced and co-directed my first film_COMMA_ and I co–wrote the feature screenplay for “Gabi on the Roof in July” with Larry Levine. I am in both a writing and directing group and these have been great experiences. Right now_COMMA_ I’d say biggest collaborative project is my 8+ years of teaching. I have developed my book in collaboration with my students_COMMA_ who are from all over the world_COMMA_ with all kinds of backgrounds. At their best it feels like our classes wire into a spaceship and the group takes off_COMMA_ enjoying an exponential growth in insight that is profoundly healing and productive. I have also collaborated with my students to become a new person. They don’t need to know it – I only tell them if its useful for their development – but they have taught me a self respect and self esteem I never had before My screenwriting work is collaborative in that I do drafts with input from friends_COMMA_ actors_COMMA_ and producers_COMMA_ and in directing I collaborate with actors_COMMA_ crews and the realties of the day to make shoots work. In a larger sense_COMMA_ I think all of us – and the earth – exist in collaboration with each other_COMMA_ and divisions between us are arbitrary and meaningless. In practice_COMMA_ I need time alone_COMMA_ especially since the time I spend with people touches such a deep place in me. So_COMMA_ like many artists I would say I swing between opening and closing – humans and solitude. I’ve been doing a lot of writing and it’s lonely. Its also lonely to do as much teaching as I do since the opening and closing is both intense and needfully boundaried. I would be excited to deal with this opening and closing in the context of the SMT community_COMMA_ and see where it could go in new and creative directions.,http://www.hulu.com/watch/389262_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Hi this below is my latest thing- its the notes for the nuerotic's journey portion of my book.

This would inform the work in my book about the building blocks of reality that create patterning for neurotic heroes Part of what I am working on with the book is the leaving behind the known into the unknown in the sense of it being a mix of things that have not been synthesized before in a screenwriting book- personal experience_COMMA_ psychology_COMMA_ philosophy_COMMA_ film theory_COMMA_ direct experience. I am liberated by the feminist notion of writing from the body - that the personal is political_COMMA_ which reminds me of Ponty’s radical embrace of the physical as the spiritual. I think this will lead to a more profound investigation of constructing being and not being_COMMA_ both in my book and my films. Being so in love with Deluze’s idea of the rhizome_COMMA_ and cinema space and time which has informed my approach to my book_COMMA_ I am excited to continue work with Ben to investigating embodiment in the Ponty and Zen traditions.

I can't help but think quite a bit about the different ways we have and hold thoughts and information and I'm endlessly fascinated with how we convey what's inside to the outside. The most interesting kind of people to me in my early life were those who wore their stories on weather-worn faces or showed their stripes through their sartorial selections or whose gravelled voices echoed the sounds or the roads they'd tread. I wanted nothing more than to spend time up near people that had been marinating in experience daily until I encountered art theory at university - a whole kind of metaphysical idea world opened up that gave language_COMMA_ crazy_COMMA_ opaque_COMMA_ neologistic art language to the communicative elements of experience. Ideas across time and space and culture and all that. Then science was thrown into the mix. I wanted to do something practical with my working time and my most cultivated practise was conversation_COMMA_ so_COMMA_ naturally_COMMA_ I became a mental health nurse. In job interviews_COMMA_ when a medical or nursing professional asks me why I made the move from art history to nursing_COMMA_ I always give the same response: Both are fundamentally about communication. They love that_COMMA_ and it's true. I've been working as a nurse for three years with a little break to move to London_COMMA_ UK and work at Wellcome Collection_COMMA_ a sensational health/medicine/art museum and to start a thematic talk radio show on NTSlive.co.uk and to write reviews of art shows and art works and to steep in culture and the wacky anomaly of London as a place. _NEWLINE_At the moment_COMMA_ I continue to make radio - show themes of late include Crying_COMMA_ Laughing_COMMA_ Restlessness_COMMA_ and Idle No More - I am also working with a visual artist on a sculpture/installation exploring the concept of the self_COMMA_ and I am writing a zine about loss with a creative witchy woman. I daylight/nightlight as a nurse with an outpatient day program and in inpatient psychiatry at two inner-city Toronto hospitals.,Though communicating with yourself is vital and important and interesting_COMMA_ the complications that arise in communicating to another person is what really gets me excited. I'd wager all my ideas are sparked from human interaction. One reliable feature about a person is they are not like another. It's nuts!_NEWLINE_In the clinical work I do (which is an integral part of my practise)_COMMA_ I collaborate closely with my patients to convey or reinforce their self-reported symptoms and needs and I collaborate with a team of 60 or so nurses_COMMA_ psychiatrists_COMMA_ specialists_COMMA_ social workers_COMMA_ occupational therapists and support staff to make plans for medications_COMMA_ therapies_COMMA_ housing_COMMA_ welfare_COMMA_ community supports like case-managers or addictions services_COMMA_ truly all manner of Real Stuff. It is very complicated work made almost fun by a shared attitude of 'help each other!' and acting upon thought instead of thinking upon thought. It's an activating kind of collaboration and the sort of work that inspires time away from work to think about all the action._NEWLINE_In creative work_COMMA_ I started Lipstick Studios (so named for our brand of courage_COMMA_ lipstick)_COMMA_ a weekly radio talk show_COMMA_ with co-host Angela Shackel. We collaborated to produce every episode until I moved from London to Toronto in October 2013. This was my first creative collaboration and it was ripe with all kinds of material for thinking on communication. We continue to support one another by sharing notes on shows. The experience of collaboration teaches me a great deal about my own work and has changed the way I hear or see the work of others. This collaboration has led to others - the sculpture/installation and the zine. _NEWLINE_Relationships (with the self_COMMA_ those in networks of support_COMMA_ civic and community_COMMA_ all kinds_COMMA_ every kind!) and politics are fundamentally what I think about.

Hypotheses of why we cry from evolutionary psychology_COMMA_ social history and contemporary theory of affect and emotion were explained as well as the phsyiology of the act.

Some of my writing is here:_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_http://tolovein.blogspot.ca/2014/02/the-interstellar-mission-of-ceaseless.html_NEWLINE_http://tolovein.blogspot.ca/2013/07/bee-ginnings_11.html_NEWLINE_https://vimeo.com/88019972_NEWLINE_http://www.yorku.ca/etopia/docs/intersections2010/Cherney.pdf,https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8JIMZG89Pfoa0JGZGwtT3BwLVU/edit,Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING),I am a Toronto-based thinker_COMMA_ maker_COMMA_ mover and writer. I'm currently a doctoral candidate in the Ryerson-York Joint Program in Communication and Culture and holds an MA in Philosophy from Concordia University. In my work I gather together movement_COMMA_ philosophy and a critical engagement with performance. My doctoral research_COMMA_ seeks to engage phenomenology as practice: as a mode of embodied engagement and research that enables me to describe and articulate the process of learning movement. dance creation can open the body up to noticing new possibilities for movement and sensory engagement. Likewise phenomenology_COMMA_ as a branch of philosophy concerned with describing the structures of human experience and perceptual life_COMMA_ demands that we suspend the expectations and sedimentations of our ordinary ways of engaging with the world in order to see things as they really are._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_It is frustrating to me that academics who write about performance often lack any developed sensitivities to that medium; it is equally tiring that artists who work in performance-based arenas often lack the necessary intellectual rigour to be viewed as innovators within the realm of academic knowledge production. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I do palliative care support work one day a week at a hospital in Toronto. Last week I took my four year old friend_COMMA_ Nella to a dance show and it was the best day I've had so far in 2014. I make things that are true and difficult. Or at least_COMMA_ that's what my mom says.,In my current work_COMMA_ I ask questions about movement_COMMA_ authenticity_COMMA_ memory and habit. I am specifically interested descriptive analysis_COMMA_ based on the work of think in how the work of thinkers such as French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty_COMMA_ can provide insight into the experience of movement habits_COMMA_ space and time_COMMA_ as shaped by our everyday encounters with the world. Further_COMMA_ I am curious as to how the experience of learning dance can shed insight into the ways that we acquire embodied habits through our experiences with other people_COMMA_ which are then reflected or taken up in the ways we move. It is easy to think here of an example such as posture or way of walking as it might relate to experiences and feelings someone has about themselves. My research operates on a “practice as research” model_COMMA_ which consists of a studio practice of learning historical work by artists such as Deborah Hay_COMMA_ Trisha Brown and Yvonne Rainer. In learning these pieces_COMMA_ it is my goal to think carefully about how this era of postmodern dance is understood_COMMA_ historically situated_COMMA_ as undoing past sedimentations and ways of working. Many scholars have studied this era in dance history_COMMA_ yet only a few (including Toronto-based artist Megan Andrews)_COMMA_ have chosen to approach it from the angle of actually dancing. The central question of this research revolves around how movement learning reveals our articulations of the world and how these articulations reveal important relationships between our bodies and the world_COMMA_ between our own body and the perception of the bodies of other people. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I seek to create a third person window into perceptual experience. In my work I aim to set up heightened conditions for seeing_COMMA_ sensing and recording the experiences of other people. I am interested in notions of authenticity in movement_COMMA_ documentation as a performative practice_COMMA_ witnessing_COMMA_ and questions surrounding the possibilities for intimacy in digitally mediated performance spaces. I have a dynamic engagement with philosophical method: I see this as one modality of articulation for choreographic thought_COMMA_ and an atunement of my dance practice. The intersection of my academic and artistic work is a space of jointure_COMMA_ where the articulating joint is dance itself that in turns lends mobility to working in scholarly and studio based forms. I often inhabit each of these fields separately from one another_COMMA_ but conceive of my practice as being distributed between_COMMA_ and informed by_COMMA_ both the academic and artistic realms.,"This is a program note I wrote for my friend_COMMA_ Amelia Ehrhardt's piece_COMMA_ ""Traditional Dance"".

I only know about her technical prowess because we go to ballet class together on Monday nights. With the word ‘technician’ I don’t just mean her skill at executing ballet vocabulary. The quality of being technical_COMMA_ here_COMMA_ also refers to a particular way of spatializing meaning. Technology is objectification in the sense that it makes meaning tangible in the form of language_COMMA_ spoken or choreographic. To say that someone is a technician is to say that they use technology. In other words_COMMA_ a moving body – i.e._COMMA_ Amelia – uses a particular expression built through materializing ideas in the language of movement (technology) to make an inscription in time and memory._NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_By entering into the realm of language_COMMA_ we enter the domain of shared meaning. Deposits into this arena of shared meaning are freely available to be taken up by or ‘decoded’ because the use of technology has both semantic and material dimensions. In fact_COMMA_ the semantic is often the domain of communication and intelligibility. Dance training_COMMA_ because it is just like every other kind of language learning_COMMA_ moves back and forth between the material and the semantic. There is an important conversation to be had about the acquisition of information through movement training_COMMA_ wherein we sediment the sense data of experiential movement by inscribing it in our bodies. There is value to thinking carefully about the materiality and specificity of dance vocabulary. Another way to think about it: language reveals what there is left unsaid.",When I was 22 I lived in a communal house. It didn't work so well.

Largely this kind of work is shit and a lousy excuse for people to do whatever the hell they feel like doing because somebody did a really bad job paraphrasing what it means to think about a body without organs. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I really think it is possible to be practically inspired by thinking along with Deleuze in a way that extends the notion of boundaries beyond the limit of phenomenology.

A link to one of my favourite activities from last summer's teaching:_NEWLINE_https://oxbridgeacademicprograms.wordpress.com/2013/07/11/oxtrad-philosophy-goes-happiness-hunting/,Link as above:_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B9JMVWWtLRRgU0xmZ1FwbjNQYVE&usp=sharing,Session A (BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE // RECONSTRUCTING WILDNESS),My central project is empathy. By which I mean_COMMA_ the process of gently leaving to one side our own judgements and emotions_COMMA_ and giving our full attention to the felt reality of another human being. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE__NEWLINE_How do I work with empathy? First_COMMA_ I practice it. Through training in the techniques of ‘Nonviolent Communication’ (an empathy-centred approach to conflict resolution taught world-wide by hundreds of trainers)_COMMA_ I learn (slowly!) how to bring empathy into my personal relationships. And I have begun to share these techniques with others by running weekly workshops in Oxford. Participants typically feedback that they find empathy to be a radically different_COMMA_ and hugely enriching_COMMA_ way of being with other people._NEWLINE__NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Second_COMMA_ I think about it. I am writing a PhD at the University of Oxford on the centrality of empathy to morality. My affiliation is to the philosophy department_COMMA_ but my work draws on fields ranging from neuroscience to literary theory. My hunch is that *Western* approaches to Ethics have neglected empathy_COMMA_ failing to see its centrality in the way of understanding others that is foundational to having moral concern for them._NEWLINE__NEWLINE__NEWLINE_What else? _NEWLINE__NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I’ve spent a total of forty days at silent meditation retreats. I yoga_COMMA_ often. Last summer_COMMA_ I walked 800 kilometres across Spain in a pilgrimage that led me to confront overwhelming angers and griefs I didn’t know I carried. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I have 1000+ hours experience leading outdoor education with children. And I have a particular interest in treasure hunts (more on this below). I think a lot about how to utilise innovative pedagogical approaches to create deep learning experiences in the classroom. A course I ran last summer on ‘philosophy of good life’ took students beyond the classical texts to visit a Buddhist temple and an organic farm_COMMA_ and to conduct happiness creation experiments on the streets of Oxford.,A central theme in my work with empathy is creating encounters between people that facilitate independent working. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE__NEWLINE_One of the gifts of offering empathy to another person_COMMA_ is that you create a space for them to empathise with themselves. That is_COMMA_ when you attentively and lovingly acknowledge their felt reality - their emotions_COMMA_ longings_COMMA_ memories_COMMA_ pains - you give them space and confidence to do it for themselves. And that can be tremendously healing. The healing work is done by themselves_COMMA_ but facilitated and enabled by the collaborative space. I try to create these spaces in my workshops._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_In my formal academic work_COMMA_ I enjoy creating a similar kinds of spaces. Typically_COMMA_ this takes the form of exchanging presentations on latest thinking with fellow graduate students. Even if the other person does not say anything_COMMA_ even if I am ‘doing all of the work’_COMMA_ I find their presence tremendously helpful. It imposes a clarity and rigour on my thought. More than that_COMMA_ it makes me honest. In asking another person to attend to my work_COMMA_ I must ask myself ‘is this really worth paying attention to? Do I really care about it?’. If the answer is anything other than an emphatic yes_COMMA_ I look to reconnect with my work and / or redirect it. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_This demand for authentic passion is even stronger when I teach. When young people entrust me with their time_COMMA_ I feel moved to provide them with learning that will inspire and empower them (as opposed to boring them or disillusioning them). Thus I must ask: does this material - this theory - really inspire and empower me? _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Academic collaboration is also an invaluable source of feedback and advice for future learning.,How do you turn Shakespeare into a treasure hunt suitable for business executives?_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Much of my most creative work has occurred in the outdoor education context. To begin with_COMMA_ this involved working as an instructor at a summer camp for children. It then evolved into the notion of running day-long treasure hunts for adults_COMMA_ utilising cars_COMMA_ codes_COMMA_ spying_COMMA_ and buried treasure. Themes ranged from ‘the quest for the Holy Grail’_COMMA_ to ‘Surviving the Credit Crunch’. In summer 2012_COMMA_ this enthusiasm led me on to a month-long commissioned project for a Shakespeare education charity_COMMA_ who asked: how can we find a new way of engaging corporate supporters with our work?_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_My answer was to come up with a Shakespearean themed murder mystery treasure hunt_COMMA_ utilising a cast of 6 actors_COMMA_ and 3 historic locations in the city of London. After a chilling investigation of a murder scene (think: dark room_COMMA_ only lit by the candles atop the rose-strewn altar; on that altar lies a cold body_COMMA_ clutching a photo and a dictaphone) participants spent two hours solving clues and interviewing suspects and witnesses_COMMA_ before coming to a verdict. The plot contained elements from Romeo and Juliet_COMMA_ Hamlet_COMMA_ and numerous history plays. The challenge was in working out which plot would lead you to the killer (was it romantic suicide? The jealous brother? Or the power-hungry rivals?)._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The event was run with their office staff and trustees (see photos in the link below)_COMMA_ and received excellent feedback (one trustee - a former deputy governer of the Bank of England - told me enthusiastically that I could make a lot of money offering this to American tourists. Then again_COMMA_ maybe it was just because he won.)_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I also once made a birthday treasure hunt for a friend that featured glow-in-the dark murals of Platonic dialogues_COMMA_ and a message in a bottle being discovered in Sri Lanka._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_One of my central aspirations for the coming years is to find a way of bringing this creative energy into my academic work on empathy (see below for more thoughts on this)._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Link for photos and clues from Shakespeare event (as above):_NEWLINE_https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B9JMVWWtLRRgU0xmZ1FwbjNQYVE&usp=sharing,In summer 2011_COMMA_ I spent eight weeks as a member of an eleven person team that travelled through the Balkans (Croatia_COMMA_ Bosnia_COMMA_ Kosovo_COMMA_ Serbia) delivering sport and play activities to disadvantaged children. We worked together_COMMA_ lived together_COMMA_ travelled together (in a minibus). The work was exhausting. Divisions arose from love and unrequited love. Frustrations arose around the way that the trip was managed. But we survived. Even when we collided with a herd of sheep on a Bosnian road._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Learnings I took from that experience include: people appreciate having time and space to be alone. It is vital to create a space where people feel able to honestly express tensions and difficulties in a non-threatening way.,I think that the opportunity to collaborate with other passionate thinkers and artists will radically energise and inspire me in ways that I cannot predict. Is that enough?_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_In particular - I am interested in the theme of wildness. I’m interested in applying to the notion of empathy - that is_COMMA_ to consider the notion of wild empathy. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Wildness captures the sense that in connecting with ourselves_COMMA_ we radically cast of social norms around presenting ourselves. We strip off inherited ways of thinking_COMMA_ to just honestly be. This reality that lies beneath is_COMMA_ in this sense_COMMA_ wild. Empathising with ourselves is to connect with our wildness. Empathy with others is to connect with their wildness._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_But what is down there? What pains and angers do we find? What desires and longings? Is our basic nature really a compassionate one as Buddhists might proclaim?_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_And how to we feel when we encounter this wildness in ourselves and others? Terrified? Awe-inspired? Affirmed? Endeared?_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I am also interested in wildness in a second sense - in the role of wilderness as a facilitating venue for this process of connecting with our humanity; in how being in wild spaces opens us up and transforms our consciousness. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_More generally_COMMA_ I am excited to find new creative methods to bridge the gap between philosophy and this practice that we call living.,,DISCOVERING THE WILDERNESS (WITHIN)_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_First_COMMA_ I would seek to utilise the natural setting to work on processes of self-empathy: exploring the day to day reality of how I felt to be at the residency_COMMA_ and linking this felt reality to deeper parts of myself: enthusiasms and passions_COMMA_ but also trenchant anxieties and fears_COMMA_ and mournings for lost friends & family members._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Second_COMMA_ I would seek to create encounters with other participants to start unlocking their experience of the residency_COMMA_ and how those experiences related to their stories_COMMA_ their realities. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Third: From this work_COMMA_ with myself and others_COMMA_ I would seek to piece together ‘empathic media’ that spoke to the collective experience of the residency_COMMA_ and to the deeper stories of the participants: salient photos_COMMA_ drawings_COMMA_ audio snippets_COMMA_ textual explorations. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_And finally_COMMA_ using these media_COMMA_ I would then develop an immersive ‘treasure hunt experience’ to offer other participants at the end of the residency. For a few hours_COMMA_ participants would explore the local wilderness_COMMA_ following clues based around the ‘empathic media’. A gurgling stream might provide the venue for some reflections on the passing (the transitoriness) of the residency. Under the shade of a giant tree_COMMA_ we might find images capturing salient moments of childhood. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_This_COMMA_ then_COMMA_ would be an exploration of wilderness of three levels. First_COMMA_ there is the exploring of the wild truth of others. Second_COMMA_ there is the physical exploration of the wild setting.

I find it growing out of cracks in freeway overpasses_COMMA_ and the cemented LA river._NEWLINE_my work is designing costumes for film. i spend many days in warehouses climbing ladders to reach clothing hung three levels high. i love the vintage show girl and clown hat section at Warner Brothers Costume. It’s located at the very top of aisle 15 white. it's a rag tag bunch_COMMA_ all crooked sequins and bent feathers. there's a lot of character amongst the lopsided bows. I imagine they have their own wild stories to tell.,my work is collaborative from start to finish. primarily film is created to be viewed by an audience. they interact with the medium and the story being told. but before that_COMMA_ it is imagined and shared by the writer_COMMA_ director and creative team. as a costume designer i imagine the way the world looks. each project is different. the director must also agree with my vision. with the help of other costumers_COMMA_ tailors and craftspeople we curate and create a selection of clothes that represent each character in the story. my favorite element of this process is when actors arrive for their fittings. we sift through the possibilities i've gathered until they find objects that aid them in becoming their character. it usually starts with a single item. the right pants_COMMA_ jacket or hat. and then it builds into an entire look. a real imagined person. these elements combine with hair_COMMA_ and make-up and finally walk onto the set a production designer has created. ideally at this moment an imagined world becomes unified and complete. the camera records the results. because there are so many ingredients_COMMA_ it takes a lot to create a great film. it's like alchemy. everything must combine in just the right way to become magic.,http://emilybatson.com/the-pretty-one_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_last spring i designed the costumes for a film called The Pretty One. the story follows twin sisters. one beautiful_COMMA_ colorful and living an adventurous life in the city. the other shy_COMMA_ still living at home and wearing the faded old clothes from her dead mother's closet. through a terrible accident_COMMA_ a case of mistaken identity unfolds and the shy twin finds herself mirroring her sister's life_COMMA_ only to discover a new more authentic life for herself. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_one actress played both sisters and it was fun to create two very different characters who begin to bleed into one another as the story unravels. it's a story of self exploration and acceptance. about stretching beyond the places we find comfortable. while i worked on the film_COMMA_ i was simultaneously reading a book written by Marianne Woodman a Jungian psychologist. the books used fairytales to explain the process of balancing the feminine and masculine aspects of our psyche. _NEWLINE_the films seemed to use the same type of allegory. _NEWLINE_and likewise_COMMA_ it seems to somehow fit with the theme of wildness.,after graduating from college_COMMA_ i went on the obligatory backpacking trip to europe. the first friend in my group split off to become engaged to her boyfriend in florence ( they never got married) the other fell in love with a man who owned a bungee jump on the greek island we were visiting. i found myself on a cog rail train climbing up the swiss alps to a chalet hostel. i lived there for 3 weeks and acted as the housekeeper in exchange for room and board. the owner was fastidious. there were notes stuck to every cupboard and above the sink explaining how to wash / use everything correctly. in the mornings i would do my chores. i learned that cleaning things that were already clean was far easier than cleaning things that were dirty. after work i would go for a hike with the other employees_COMMA_ or ride a bike down the mountain_COMMA_ or visit the hot springs or just sit and watch the fog roll in to the valley below. we would make communal meals in the evening_COMMA_ and slept in bunk beds at night.,i was raised in a very structured environment. there were lots of obligatory rituals. the nature of my work is quite goal and deadline oriented. clothes must fit a specific body. alterations need to be completed at a specific time. the shirt must be blue. i would really just love to be in a place that offered a different approach to living and creating. it's an experience i think i would find both challenging and liberating. exploring how to allow myself to be. to create something from what arises. it is often an impulse that get's buried in the process of daily life. this sounds like a great opportunity to relax and explore what unfolds.,,one idea is to make a quilt. something tactile. a square for each day or each new discovery. maybe each square is a written story or a painting. maybe the story is in the color and the texture of the fabric. maybe it is pieced together from fabric contributed by and holding stories from each participant in the program. i only just learned about this residency so i haven't had too much time to formulate my ideas. i'm not quite ready to commit to the exact process. but i do always like to work with fabric. and i'm interested in how that interacts with stories and experience.,question: is it too late to apply to this residency?_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_answer: i certainly hope not.,i'm committed to making time this year for a project or adventure that exists outside my chosen career field and my familiar landscape. these dates and this program seems like an ideal scenario. my schedule is varied but flexible :),my friend drew denny,i eat mostly anything.

I came here to work on two plays with a group of Lebanese and Ethiopian theater artists. With the help of a grant I’ll be here two months. I arrived yesterday. It smells like cumin and gasoline. It’s beautiful and noisy. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I mostly write plays_COMMA_ which means I live in a world of making things with other people. It also means I run away to my room to write. I have a big crush on novels_COMMA_ and essays_COMMA_ I think because I love how intimate reading is – language structures pass into one’s brain and talk with thoughts and memories. I’d like my plays to do that too._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I studied humanities at Yale_COMMA_ and then moved to Savannah with friends to start an arts nonprofit. The nonprofit lives on – after-school creative writing classes for middle schoolers – but I peeled off to come to New York because I missed the hurly-burly of a bigger city. I joined a writers’ group called Youngblood_COMMA_ and helped start a theater company called American Centaur. I’ve found collaborators who are kindred spirits. Lately I’ve been working on projects other people initiated: an adaptation of a Yiddish novel_COMMA_ an adaptation of Love’s Labours Lost_COMMA_ a musical about Earth First!_COMMA_ and now an adaptation with music of 20_COMMA_000 Leagues Under the Sea. (I guess it seems like a lot of adaptations_COMMA_ but “adaptation” is a veeeery loose term.) These are all in various stages of happening/just-happened/will-happen-one-day. It’s nice to have people with a certain amount of infrastructure approach me about joining them as a writer. It can be a challenge to take on material I didn’t select. I’ve learned a lot. I love it. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I write essays_COMMA_ too. But super slowly.,For a while I thought I might have been a maker of devised theater_COMMA_ who enters a rehearsal room with a set of questions and prompts_COMMA_ guides a flock of actors_COMMA_ and stitches together the resulting material into a “collaborative” piece. Now I think I am mostly a playwright_COMMA_ which is to say_COMMA_ someone who writes a play and brings it to rehearsal. I like following a thought very far down a road. Also I’m not good at talking about how a thing should be_COMMA_ I’m better at just making the thing itself_COMMA_ based on inarticulate thoughts and sensations – I stew for weeks and then write something askew_COMMA_ just so_COMMA_ aslant from reality in some satisfyingly itchy way. Once the thing is there_COMMA_ on a page_COMMA_ it is a joy to talk about it with collaborators_COMMA_ to test its joints and see what squeaks_COMMA_ to be challenged in the spots where I pulled up short to dive deeper. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I recently made a piece in which I wrote a script for a particular group of actors_COMMA_ some of whom I knew well and others of whom I didn’t. They all played characters who had their actual names. One told me that it was uncanny_COMMA_ how close to home some of the lines I’d written for him hit. (I’m interested in understanding that more: why?) Increasingly_COMMA_ I’m interested in this process of writing for specific performers because real people are strange and lovely and tug my writing in unexpected directions._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_A good playwright knows how to strike each element of live theater – objects_COMMA_ actors_COMMA_ space_COMMA_ audience – and let it ring out loud clear and beautiful in its own key. That’s good collaboration_COMMA_ I think.,This is not a project I initiated or wrote but that’s partly my point. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Two summers ago_COMMA_ I played one of the students in a bootleg punk-anarchist Les Mis that I heard about and showed up for. There were fifty-two of us. We lived in a field and rehearsed under a circus tent. I had a few solo lines but mostly I sang in the chorus and carried around a paper-mache gun and looked adoringly at the actor playing Enjolras. I learned to use a sewing machine_COMMA_ I learned how to sing high without hurting my voice_COMMA_ I learned how to dumpster dive_COMMA_ I got terribly sick_COMMA_ I washed naked in the woods_COMMA_ I made dear friends_COMMA_ and I sprained an ankle. All fifty-two of us were putting in sixteen-hour days. I’d come because I wanted to. I liked just about everyone. Still_COMMA_ I found myself retreating into an I sometimes_COMMA_ and the big thing I learned was how not run away from a We. I’s are important and it’s easy to hold fast to an I because your I is what you know. We is no one’s I_COMMA_ We is uncertain_COMMA_ I can’t control We. When We finally performed Les Mis – six times_COMMA_ in four cities – We were performing a schmaltzy Broadway hit but we were also performing the We we’d made in that month in that field. The whole endeavor was ridiculous_COMMA_ and We were performing the strangeness of We’s loyalty to it. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_That gets at something essential to me: Set up something ridiculous_COMMA_ and have the perverse patience to be loyal to it. Step out of what you know_COMMA_ and have the courage to stand on ridiculous ground. When you do that_COMMA_ people gather_COMMA_ however ridiculously_COMMA_ and when people gather and work hard and are silly together… that’s sacred.,That summer in Vermont was one. Fifty people lived in tents and ate together and worked together and took turns emptying the bucket we all pooped in. I worked hard_COMMA_ and occasionally took time to myself – that was how I existed in that space. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Until recently_COMMA_ I lived in a nine-person warehouse space in Brooklyn. There was no unifying project – people generally kept to themselves – but we shared cleaning duties_COMMA_ and had to make a couple of thorny decisions as a group. Those decisions were tricky_COMMA_ and one in particular caused some damage – mostly to one house member in particular_COMMA_ but to everyone else_COMMA_ too_COMMA_ I’d argue. My read on it is this: There were longstanding rules and policies about house membership. Rules are important. But. It’s dangerous to avoid open conversation about conflict in favor of impartial rule-enforcement. Rules are rules_COMMA_ but people are people_COMMA_ and the chance to hear and be heard are what allow us to live together well._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I love cooking with people. I love standing in a kitchen together_COMMA_ with people coming and going. I love cleaning up together. I love huge stacks of mismatched plates.,Last year I fell in love with a few anarchist thinkers_COMMA_ and this year I fell in love with a few Jewish thinkers. I love the anarchists because they love the mess of uncertainty_COMMA_ and because they remind me to walk and encounter people and worlds without the handrails of the familiar. I love the Jewish thinkers because they love the creative power of structure. They have a radical commitment to constructing spaces – however narrow-seeming – of the sacred in this world. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The session on wildness seems like a space where anarchists and Jews might meet._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I’m interested in how that space might inform my creative practice. I’d relish the chance to leave the physical architecture of New York City_COMMA_ and the familiar mental architecture of the writer’s space or rehearsal room. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_My instinct is that Jewish law exists in conversation with the world’s wildness. My instinct is that clarifying the ground on which one stands – which is what Jewish law is doing – allows one to relate to wildness without demand_COMMA_ or possessiveness. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Because as much as I love anarchist thought_COMMA_ I worry that an infatuation with a certain aesthetic of anarchy (as opposed to an anarchist way of thinking) risks exploiting the people and the world around us. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_My plays are always part prayer; they are a form of research into freedom. I am always trying to catch something alive_COMMA_ delicate_COMMA_ green-smelling_COMMA_ wild in my plays_COMMA_ however carefully constructed and rigorously rehearsed.,"I'm interested in forgetting as a creative practice. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I'm still working out what that means._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I'm interested in how forgetting -- or at least attending to the spaces around the things we can't remember -- creates space for self-reinvention. I've always felt like I'll never be the old Henry James ""writer is someone on whom nothing is lost"" thing because I have such a bad memory for things._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I'm interested in exploring how lapses in memory make us who we are. I'm interested in how our lapses interact with others' rememberings_COMMA_ or vice versa_COMMA_ and how lapses behave when they meet other lapses. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I'm interested in exploring strong emotional attachments that have been emptied of any content (""I don't remember why I love this place""). Could we fabricate such attachments? _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I'm interested in the fear that attends the possibility of not knowing some key part of one's past. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I'd like to investigate ways of reproducing such blank spaces in art_COMMA_ especially embodied art like theater or dance or film.",I am interested in a play as a container_COMMA_ and dramatic structure – however loosely understood – as architecture. So: I would like to build a small room that was also a play. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I would use my limited building skills – and perhaps acquire new ones – to construct the room from wood_COMMA_ fabric_COMMA_ plastic_COMMA_ glass… As I build the room_COMMA_ I’d be writing text that corresponds to different parts of the space. A song for this hole_COMMA_ an argument for that roof beam. I’m curious if paying attention to what makes a sturdy room could result in an unexpectedly sturdy but nonlinear play. Depending on how far I get_COMMA_ I might sleep in the room_COMMA_ eat in the room_COMMA_ host other people who want to come visit the room_COMMA_ and see how all that could inform the play. There will of course be chinks in the room for breeze or rain or grass smells and of course the hope is that those things end up in the play_COMMA_ too. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Texts behind this are maybe Woolf_COMMA_ A Room of One’s Own_COMMA_ Baldwin_COMMA_ Giovanni’s Room_COMMA_ Heschel on the architecture of time_COMMA_ and Renee Gladman’s on architectural sentences and imaginary places.,Do you feel good at talking about your art? Do you think it's important to be good at talking about your art? _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I don't feel great at talking about my art. I'm getting better. I know it can be super helpful to be able to talk about one's art_COMMA_ but I think I also would like to make that doesn't quite bear talking about.,I might have an obligation (also upstate) that wraps up June 8_COMMA_ but other than that would be available for either the hike or Session A.,a friend - Adam Horowitz,I don't eat meat_COMMA_ but other than that anything. I do eat eggs.

I'm a musician who studied classical piano for 8 years and now is trying her luck as a singer in an alternative rock band. I'm someone who improvises. Who has a quick wit. Who likes puns and isn't afraid to throw you one the moment it occurs to her. I'm someone who understands rhythm. Who wonders if I should try freestyling for reals because any time I give it a go at a party I'm kind of ridiculously awesome at it. I'm a writer with lots of ideas (and scenes) but who has yet to write her first full length play. I am a theater and film goer and music listener with a keen eye and ear for what moves me and captures me and surprises me and what looks forced and pushed and cliche and patronizing. I'm a passionate artist who wants to create that which moves and captures and surprises and transports people. I'm someone who thinks she'd make a great director -- of film or theater -- because she understands what it is to be an actor and what it is to be an audience and because she can communicate and consider and lead and follow. I'm someone who thinks she'd make an excellent DJ because she knows what kind of music drives her to dance and she thinks it's excellent stuff. I am an actress who does really good work. Work her classmates and teachers admire. Work that landed her a full tuition scholarship to ACT_COMMA_ and has landed her some great jobs and gotten her some great reviews. I'm an actress who doesn't work as much as she'd like to. I'm an actress who wants to create something.,I've learned that the best kind of acting is collaborative. When actors are really playing off each other. The circle of collaborators in this case is made wider by the director and the playwright_COMMA_ and in performance the audience - all offering further possibilities for integration and inspiration. My goal as an actor is to do my preparation_COMMA_ to know where I'm coming from_COMMA_ and then to remain open to how these other elements will affect or guide me in the moment. When the channels are open it can feel like these elements are working both with me and through me. It feels sublime_COMMA_ and I daresay spiritual. There's excitement in the unknown and anchoring in the flow of what's happening. I've encountered something similar in music_COMMA_ which is why I'm now in a band._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Collaboration also exists at a far more messy_COMMA_ less polished level. And the creative work I've done with Clown_COMMA_ Improv_COMMA_ Movement based composition_COMMA_ and Sketch Comedy are examples of that. There is usually more chaos_COMMA_ more mess_COMMA_ and perhaps a need for more negotiation_COMMA_ and compromise. Navigating those waters with my co-creators can become an art itself_COMMA_ but things generally just find a way of taking shape and working out. It's very cool to be a part of that. There is often such willingness in the room_COMMA_ such allowance_COMMA_ and such a unique group dynamic_COMMA_ that the work we end up with is something we never could have found without each other or without the mess.,"Senior year at Brown I took a class called Solo Performance. 12 students wrote 12 solo shows. My show was called Whitenoise; it was about my family. The divorce_COMMA_ the remarriages_COMMA_ the coming of age_COMMA_ the dark secrets_COMMA_ and perhaps more interesting the stories about my grandmother_COMMA_ her use of LSD_COMMA_ a shady character she dated_COMMA_ and what he might or might not have done to my aunt. It was easy enough to pour out the material. To bring it in and perform it for my peers. But the piece really came together when I decided to incorporate a performance art device I'd developed a year earlier in a class called Advanced Performance. Our professor had given us the assignment ""Overheard Conversations;"" I eavesdropped at cafes_COMMA_ took notes_COMMA_ and poured over them...how would I perform this_COMMA_ what was the link... I arrived at a conclusion about superficiality -- that sometimes we need the superficial just to converse -- and this led me to the idea of animating one's face with make up in order to communicate. In the practicing of it_COMMA_ I discovered exciting nuanced choices I could make. In the performing of it...success! The class loved it. An exchange took place. And the feedback from that class inspired me to bring it in to the next one_COMMA_ where I found out it could server to anchor my show. I explored the construct further the following year when I performed a shortened version of the show - or you might call it a lengthened version of the performance art - at two different spaces in San Francisco. I use this example so you can get a sense of how I might play with an idea_COMMA_ and how I might work with that idea and bring it to performance. Although the creation was a solo venture_COMMA_ without the classes_COMMA_ without the spaces and the people that inspired risk_COMMA_ accepted flops_COMMA_ offered feedback_COMMA_ and hoped for brilliance_COMMA_ nothing would have happened.",I am my happiest in communal living situations. I currently live in my 6th communal sitch since college. I've found most on Craigslist_COMMA_ including this one. I joined a 7 roommate_COMMA_ 3 story house in Ditmas Park just a couple summers ago. A house with a porch_COMMA_ laundry_COMMA_ the occasional Sunday night dinner_COMMA_ and even some biggish parties. Totally awesome stuff for yours truly. Then our lease holder's girlfriend moved in_COMMA_ and the couple began fighting and calling the cops on each other and throwing computer monitors down the stairs and giving each other black eyes_COMMA_ so I and three girls moved out. We're now in the top 2 floors of another lovely house with laundry and porches in the same hood. We have dinner parties sometimes and are looking forward to using our lovely back garden when the weather gets nice. Oh and there are no big fights or black eyes. We get along really really well.,Sometimes I'm told I think too much. It's true. I do. I can. However I have my brain to thank for some of the biggest blessings I've encountered in my life_COMMA_ and some of the greatest achievements. I like the idea of exploring thinking. Perhaps by not thinking. Knowing by not knowing. I believe that my heart and soul and instincts are perhaps smarter and more keenly equipped to lead my artistic endeavors than my mind_COMMA_ yet my mind is certainly a necessary part of the equation! I'm interested in what I might be separating from or letting go of by unthinking. How this might change my approach to projects or life in general. Or what I might integrate into my process by knowing thinking differently. It seems confusing and therefore rich ground for me to play in. It also parallels a theme I'm pondering in my life right now...letting go versus showing up. When to release. When to follow. When to think. When to know. When to not know. When to not think. Trusting. Leaping. Tuning in to flow._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_As I mentioned before I'm a girl with ideas. Maybe it's the Libra Moon/Rising in me. They say airy people have lots of ideas they don't follow through on. I also have an Aries sun (opposite sign of Libra) so if there is validity to this stuff it may help to explain why I can be a bit of a frustrated artist or individual. Pulled by polarity. One who has fiery instincts to follow_COMMA_ but keen to consider and weigh the possible outcomes. I want a blank canvas. Space. Time. To play. To develop something. To integrate the ideas and the skills. A play. A film. A performance art piece. Webisodes. I'm truly not sure yet. But I'm capable. And I'm talented. And I look forward to discovering the piece would manifest through me at SMT.,,"There was a time I stood on the subway platform at Broadway/Lafayette_COMMA_ and I stared at the sign that read ""Broadway"" above this little cutout in the wall that almost looked like a door. I imagined myself sitting there with a pickaxe_COMMA_ slowly chiseling away like a scene in a Matthew Barney film. Eventually I'd find a door behind the concrete and I'd chisel and pull and finally end up crawling out of a hole in a big green field somewhere and I'd look down and see this tiny little rock I crawled out of. And then I'd drop kick it down the field. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I can envision creating and directing a film at SMT that has a bridge between the real and the unreal. I imagine special effects and/or animation would help to most fully realize this_COMMA_ but the goal would be to make the viewer intimate with the main character's mind. How she sees_COMMA_ how she dreams. Perhaps her journey would be about how she uses the unreal to function in the real_COMMA_ and/or vice versa_COMMA_ or where she finally chooses to dwell and why. Something rich in images and dreamlike ideas. Perhaps the film just is fantasy and there would be nothing real about it. Other than the character's journey. A recognizably human one.",What will you want to teach your children when it comes to art? I will encourage play. Lots of play! I will sing to them at night and join in when they sing in the car. Any old nonsense. I will make sure they spend plenty of time outside. I will teach them how to build troll houses by the stream and sing songs around a campfire and I will encourage the building of forts in a variety of locations with a variety of materials. I will encourage time alone for them. To think. To draw. To nurture their imaginations. I will love what they do and encourage them to love what they do too. (For the record_COMMA_ I don't have kids. But I felt inclined to write this. When I think of my inner artist I think about childhood. Mine and my unborn's.) And to close I'd just like to add this quote from Einstein a friend just posted on Facebook: Play is the highest form of research. Thank you!!,None that I know of at this time. (Also I'm sorry this is late. I saw it on Josephine's Facebook feed at the last minute and thought...yeah... yes. Hope it is still acceptable. Cheers.),Josephine Decker,I'll eat anything for the most part_COMMA_ but if I eat meat I prefer it be organic. I like organic stuff in general. Also raw milk or raw milk cheeses is nice.

I started in TV to create a network run entirely by children. that was 1993-ish. I have - to an extent - done that successfully in small pieces_COMMA_ but the $$ has been a little challenging.

Lately I've been doing some shooting for THE DOCTORS_COMMA_ a daytime talk show_COMMA_ shooting vagina-related material. children's tv. fashion. vaginas. I'm on a roll... and I am loving shooting for other people instead of just for my own projects. I want to build my well spring muscle_COMMA_ the thoughtful and grounded joy that gushes tactfully out of oneself - that is based on one's love for life and experiences and both makes sense and is mysteriously ethereal and not-able-to-be-planned.

I like to pull a team together based on what each person does well_COMMA_ and create from there. that said_COMMA_ I can be an anxiety monster and that is probably my greatest professional and creative obstacle. I know the way to make my projects be finished well and on time and there is not always the time to give everyone to their creative processes. this is the greatest challenge working with children - the perfect storm of process and product. a brilliant video editor has been MY key to driving the project into excellence.,I wrote poems and Short Short Stories in my early twenties to overcome writers block.

They stayed with us until they found an apartment_COMMA_ usually with other friends of ours or theirs - all blended together. My second 'communal' apartment was great too. We all cooked meals together_COMMA_ had a 'house' grocery list that we all shared in $ and collecting (bulk and farmers market). One of my roommates was founding the Wise Fool Puppet Company so even though I was working ridiculous hours (overnight work shifts and school all day)_COMMA_ I could still come home and help make puppets for a while_COMMA_ share a meal that we all cooked_COMMA_ and take a bath which was my then-version of eight hours of sleep. I also had the added benefit of participating in all the Wise Fool events - parades_COMMA_ plays. I could pop my stilts on and go... able to keep my own packed schedule and still participate in and support my friends amazing company.

I like that it seems a little loose but still has required reading_COMMA_ as well as challenges for the mind/body/spirit.,off the top of my head:_NEWLINE_1) everyone offers one word. each person must make a poem out of everyone's words and then do a poetry reading_NEWLINE_2) each person must make one adornment out of the natural environment and this adornment is the core of their character during one whole meal with the others_NEWLINE_3) in a river_COMMA_ each participant makes a sculpture in the moving water out of stones. one (self) selected gallery guide takes the group for a tour of each sculpture as each artist tells how his/her work is like their grandmother - or any older ancestor they choose,I have shot a couple of interviews and would like to shoot MANY of people talking about the first time they had sex.

My virtue is the questions that I can't let go of; the why_COMMA_ the so what_COMMA_ the what for_COMMA_ and the what does it mean. As tiring and difficult as they are_COMMA_ I am committed to them. My work deals more with the ""how"" of fear. Fear as a given element in a social life_COMMA_ and how to acknowledge_COMMA_ allow_COMMA_ and circumvent fear of other people that keeps me moving and can push me to isolation. Through my work_COMMA_ individual or collaborative_COMMA_ my goal is to create situations and systems that bring people toward each other. I draw on tactics from relational aesthetics and social practice_COMMA_ engineering spaces for interaction and producing relationships as the work of art. For example_COMMA_ I have worked with Craigslist offering my sponsorship- or advice_COMMA_ presence_COMMA_ friendship_COMMA_ mentorship- to strangers on the internet. The relationships and conversations that were born of that offer are what I consider my art. I value making myself as vulnerable as I am asking participants in my work to become. I consider my work a process or tool with which myself and those involved can grow.",My practice is often physically collaborative. I work with another person to make the piece of art. Sometimes this means building with another person_COMMA_ hashing out every measurement and angle aloud. Sometimes it means that conversation is an integral part of the project_COMMA_ and people volunteer to talk to me. Sometimes it is collaborative in that I ran my design/writing/idea by ten people in my community before I got to the final piece. I always look at my work with other people and they help me to figure out what the piece is_COMMA_ what it does_COMMA_ what it means_COMMA_ and why it exists.

I came across the program in December_COMMA_ but hadn't checked back for a deadline. I thought I should try for a spot anyway. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I am a passionate_COMMA_ curious artist_COMMA_ who likes to occupy and agitate the background. I graduate from York University in 2012 with a BFA in Visual Art and Psychology. I'm currently working on my MA in Art History at York University. I work in performance_COMMA_ sound_COMMA_ video and multiples to explore magic and queerness. I volunteer at an LGBTQ youth service in the city and regularly attend community education sessions. I try to find creative and nurturing ways to build my community_COMMA_ without falling adhering to dogmas and (sometimes limiting) tropes. I try to be aware of my energy_COMMA_ the space I find myself in and those around me (or not).,I would describe my creative/intellectual practice as mischievous. I like to slip around things and circle them. I think that humour is an important part of my practice_COMMA_ which is inherently social. Apart from it's communicative nature_COMMA_ humour is the unexpected tipping point between the ludacris and the grotesque. Play with affective poles is central to my work. My sense of humour is used to side-eye rational and/or hegemonic processes. I hope that my work creates moments of confusion and discomfort_COMMA_ which I feel are fertile spaces for growth and understanding.,I was a part of a group show in 2011 called Ululology. The show was a quasi-response to the Occupy Movement_COMMA_ which was quite active at that time. Myself and five other sound artists worked independently on projects and periodically shared our progress with one another. At the end of a few weeks_COMMA_ our work was placed in the same gallery space. None of the works were made for headphones_COMMA_ so the possibility of being heard was constantly negotiated. The volumes were altered daily to create different relationships and reconstruct the space. My project was an extremely loud_COMMA_ deep bass piece which vibrated the only seating in the room_COMMA_ and a sound track of shaking tea sets.,I aspire to live in a communal home in the future but have not been able to as of yet. I've stayed in hostels on a number of occasions for majority of my travelling_COMMA_ the longest being a 14 day stay in Vancouver. I feel that I can successfully read the room and respect the needs of those around me. I prefer to share space with others and have never had any issues with listening and communication or sharing responsibilities. I am a very clean and hardworking housemate.,"The poles of nature and culture are present in both my art practice and my research. My explorations of the supernatural always return to the laws of nature_COMMA_ religious institutions_COMMA_ essence and the body. How can something exist outside of nature if nature is all encompassing? What does it mean for something to be alive or not? In what ways is History_COMMA_ that is to say the forward facing path of civilization_COMMA_ distinct from muscle memory and memory in general? _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_For my MA research_COMMA_ I analyze the dissemination of an urban_COMMA_ self-identified ""half-breed"" indigenous filmmaker named Ariel Smith. Her videos question naivety and gender performances. I am using the trickster figure as a framework for her artistic practice and the sneaky_COMMA_ somewhat non-human characters in her work. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Also_COMMA_ I feel that the living experience itself will be a part of processing the theme. I am very excited to have the opportunity to express myself and learn from others in a communal environment.",,I would love to see underwater_COMMA_ underground or avian series of performances.

The theme of the session_COMMA_ between culture and wildness_COMMA_ is well-suited to the work that I am beginning to step into_COMMA_ though the word 'culture' definitely throws a different light on to what I am calling civilization. However_COMMA_ this dissonance has the potential for much juicy exploration_COMMA_ which I would love to engage with the support and challenge of others.,,I would facilitate a dream council_COMMA_ or a visionary council_COMMA_ or a 24hr solo fast_COMMA_ with mirroring and a communal setting of intentions. _NEWLINE_Dream councils involve the setting of sacred space_COMMA_ and the creation of a communal matrix using dream time._NEWLINE_Visioning councils are circles_COMMA_ facilitated with a theme in mind_COMMA_ allowing the community to enter into shared shikantaza_COMMA_ which is a zen term for open awareness. We will form a container which is strong enough to hold all voices_COMMA_ as the sky is vast enough to allow all forms of weather to move through._NEWLINE_The solo is an opportunity to go out into the wilderness with just water and a simple shelter. No journal. No food. Bare bones. Just you and the mirror of the wild. There is council before_COMMA_ to clarify intentions_COMMA_ and council after_COMMA_ to mirror and listen to stories.

In college_COMMA_ I studied philosophy at the University of Chicago – a school I wanted to go to because of their core curriculum (with classes like 'Self_COMMA_ Culture_COMMA_ & Society') and their “UNcommon Application”. I said in my uncommon application that I thought a liberal arts education would make me a better thinker and therefore a better artist. That was when I was 18. Now I'm 30. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I moved to NYC after college to pursue acting. I worked with an experimental theater company called the Bats at the acclaimed Flea Theater and in the NYC Fringe Festival. I learned a lot about working on new plays. Eventually_COMMA_ I realized that training was essential to my craft_COMMA_ and in 2012_COMMA_ I got my MFA in acting at Rutgers. Since Rutgers_COMMA_ I've been honing my skills working in off-Broadway and regional theater_COMMA_ film_COMMA_ and national commercials. I am always dedicated to taking my work to the next level. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I find inspiration in a diversity of interests. Currently_COMMA_ I'm working on a line of recycled denim clothing and accessories called SilkDenim_COMMA_ a screenplay_COMMA_ and I'm learning how to make films with a DSLR. I'm also engaged in feminist art. For example_COMMA_ last year I was a guest speaker in a high school girls' health class to discuss body image and feminist issues for which I created a questionnaire and inspirational handout. I love using art to explore the world_COMMA_ and I don't feel the need to limit that to one medium. All types of art inform my ability to be engaged with my surroundings and question assumptions I have about myself and the world. For I believe “the unexamined life is not worth living.”,Finding a balance between individual and collaborative work is an essential part of my creative path. Luckily_COMMA_ acting has taught me a lot about it. Despite being fundamentally collaborative_COMMA_ acting has a very solid basis of independent work that makes me aware of the difference between them and the necessity of both. When I walk into rehearsal or show up to perform_COMMA_ hours of personal preparation and body conditioning are involved. But all that preparation is really just that_COMMA_ because it is through collaboration that magic happens. Collaborating in the theater happens on many levels with many different people - the director_COMMA_ castmates_COMMA_ audiences_COMMA_ designers...on big and small levels_COMMA_ from creating the mood of the piece to deciding where to place a chair. My collaboration with the costume designer is different from my collaboration with an audience. I feel sometimes my collaboration with the audience is the most beautiful_COMMA_ but then I remember that it wouldn’t be possible without many other collaborations. Each play I do_COMMA_ I rediscover the awe of just how collaborative the theater is. Everyone has their own job_COMMA_ but all the jobs have to come together into a nightly experience for a short time. It's a challenge_COMMA_ but when it works_COMMA_ a true sense of community is created_COMMA_ and it feels awesome. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_My orientation to the world as an artist is by its very nature collaborative. I'm currently collaborating with my Mom on SilkDenim_COMMA_ I'm writing that screenplay with a friend_COMMA_ and I'm working on auditions in classes. I always find ways to engage others in projects. I find that collaborating with others keeps me motivated_COMMA_ structured_COMMA_ and challenged. In a sense_COMMA_ everything I do is collaborative. I love collaborating with friends and family_COMMA_ but I also love collaborating with a whole new group of people.,The last play I did was Parlour Song by Jez Butterworth_COMMA_ a British contemporary dark comedy about 3 people trapped in a suburban mundane existence. I played Joy_COMMA_ a depressed and desperate housewife who begins stealing her husband's things to get his attention. Joy is a seemingly 'unlikeable' character; she steals_COMMA_ lies_COMMA_ and cheats to get what she wants. And Parlour Song is a highly poetic and at times absurd play. The combination proved to be a deeply fulfilling challenge for me_COMMA_ requiring me to be a more nuanced and patient performer. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Everyone involved in this production was a truly committed_COMMA_ talented_COMMA_ and giving artist. The play itself was brilliant material. Audiences were open and engaged. As a result of all these wonderful collaborations mixed with my hard individual work_COMMA_ I learned to embrace a part of me that really brought Joy to life. And this process of learning to bring Joy to life got deeper and deeper each and every night_COMMA_ with every show_COMMA_ every talkback_COMMA_ and every kitchen table conversation._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Through hard work and collaboration_COMMA_ I saw and felt the underlying humanity in Joy and the true depth of Parlour Song. This best represents me as an artist fit for your program because it not only shows me as a successful working professional_COMMA_ but as one who_COMMA_ when put into an engaged and critical community_COMMA_ excels and thrives. It can't exactly be shown to you because you would have had to see the play_COMMA_ but it helps that we received good press. Parlour Song proved to me that I'm a skilled artist who never stops learning_COMMA_ who puts her entire self into her work_COMMA_ and who works well with others. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Parlour Song reviews: _NEWLINE_http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yksRx98QR3s_NEWLINE_http://thetartan.org/2013/11/4/pillbox/parloursong_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Pgh Post Gazette named me one of the best actresses of the year for my performance: _NEWLINE_http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2014/01/05/Daina-Michelle-Griffith-2013-Performer-of-the-Year/stories/201401050053,Once a year_COMMA_ a group of friends get together at my friend's Dad's house on Long Island. I call it my heaven. We make all our food together_COMMA_ we hang out on the rocky beach_COMMA_ we have long discussions about our lives and the future_COMMA_ we go for swims_COMMA_ walks_COMMA_ trips to buy food or pick people up_COMMA_ we collect and play with rocks. We clean up together. We spend time on everyone. We also respect when people want to be on their own and read or just be alone_COMMA_ take an outdoor shower. We build fires on the beach_COMMA_ and I always insist we roast marshmallows. We swim to the neighbor's floating trampoline and try to bounce each other off. This is heaven to me._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I've lived in a lot of different set-ups_COMMA_ but most recently it's either been alone or with my boyfriend. I love living alone_COMMA_ but I often wonder if I had more time in a large communal house setting_COMMA_ would I be more inspired to think outside the box when it comes to my art.,The question 'how can we think what we do not know how to think?' intrigues me because it reflects a kind of questioning I have about my creativity and life. I guess you could say I'm always thinking about how I think about things in the hopes that I'll teach myself how to better think about things. When you define thinking as “a questioning and investigating of the basic assumptions that define our selves_COMMA_ culture and world_COMMA_” I get very exited. I have a little fire within me that is never satisfied with the first idea_COMMA_ or with things as they are. I find that to be a natural state for me as an artist and a thinker_COMMA_ but also one that needs attention and effort_COMMA_ because it is in this state that I begin to truly create new ideas. _NEWLINE__NEWLINE_I think your program would encourage me take my creative investigation to the next level_COMMA_ and I'm looking to do so. What your school offers sounds particularly well-suited for me_COMMA_ because we have a mutual appreciation for the connection between the intellectual and the creative and for exploring innovative forms of learning. I like to talk but I also like to move_COMMA_ use my body_COMMA_ and try new things. For example_COMMA_ the extremely physical portion of the Unthinking/Unknowing session sounds really cool to me. I believe your approach may help me at this stage of my life and career_COMMA_ where I have a good foundation of skill and experience_COMMA_ but I've got something new I'm broaching that I need to get out.,,I would mount a 1-woman show based on the themes discussed in school in relation to themes I am working on as a feminist artist. I would come to the program already prepared with 5 female characters I want to explore. They would be a range of women in age and race_COMMA_ and I would use my time to create a show with these characters. I think with an unlimited budget_COMMA_ I would also bring in video and sound to make it a multi-media piece. I would start writing monologues and performing them for feedback the first week. The second week I would form the story_COMMA_ and the final days would be used to mount the show. I would want to bring in themes of beauty and body-mage_COMMA_ but mostly I would want to explore the ways in which different women grapple with their own self-worth.,What is a theme you explore in your art?_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_Like with Parlour Song_COMMA_ I explore making the despicable relatable. It's not only necessary for acting_COMMA_ but also for communicating with others_COMMA_ and it requires admitting your own faults and trying to see the good in others' faults. More than empathy_COMMA_ it's about better understanding human behavior_COMMA_ or 'bad' behavior. It's easy to designate things good or bad_COMMA_ but when I look from an artistic point of view_COMMA_ I'm forced to see new perspectives. I'm forced to re-imagine and personalize a negative stereotype in hopes of getting others to see that stereotype in themselves or in ways they hadn’t before.,N/a,A Facebook post by Josephine Decker,I only eat humanely treated/farm meat_COMMA_ but other than that I eat everything.
