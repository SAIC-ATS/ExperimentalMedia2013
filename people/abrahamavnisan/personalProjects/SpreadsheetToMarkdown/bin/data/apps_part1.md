###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Hike (A SUMMIT ON A SUMMIT)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
I am an artist and curator based in Toronto, Ontario. I was born in Moscow, Russia. My practice is organizational and curatorial : in Toronto I run a number of organizations that explore alternative approaches to image making, production, and consumption. I am interested in subverting traditional templates within the art system. I enjoy nature and physical challenge. Once I biked from Toronto to Montreal with a dog.
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
In my practice, i often crowd source to fill in the gaps or as the focus of a project. I have had several projects involving large group of people that are activated by participation. In a way, part of my work as artist-curator involves the construction of an alternate reality occupied by the artists and art projects that i become involved with. my work in publications and performance is often extremely collaborative, and I am a member of a number of loose collectives.
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
One example of a collaborative practice is my project Rearviews: a review is reviewed and that review is reviewed again by a string of people, like an exquisite corpse or a broken telephone. this eventually constitutes a publication. In the broken string of reviews are narrative that evolve between the reviewers, and which ultimately require collaborative support. In this project, people reveal themselves as tending to engage in a joined narrative that connects them as characters, not reviewers.
###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
I the summers of 2012 and 2011 I have spent a while in a local residency started by my friends and i called Don Blanche. In this residency, we would execute a number of art projects - some sculpture, some performance, some installation. we also built a sauna and a hot tub from scratch, and made a beach by ordering a lot of sand. everyone lived on cots in tents or in one big dorm and share space and meals. the residency would have between 18-40 people in it at any given time, it would last for 2 weeks.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
i am interested in improvised delivery of projects , which seems inevitable in the hike scenario. I like that it involves movement of both time and space, conceptually, this is interesting to me. I am also looking forward to becoming inspired by the mobility and physical activity involved - its refreshing to have a summit or a conference in a mobile format.
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)
something i would be interested in is the subject of score - through looking at a number of film/musical scores from hitchcock to john cage, I would be very interested in talking about the visual representation and importance of the score, as not only a document but a map. I would also be interested in having a micro reading group - where we discuss a short text impromptu, while walking, cooking or what have you,
###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)

###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
what do you hope to take from this experience? 
I am hoping to meet people. that are different or like minded, to see new approaches to presentation/ workshoopping, to learn some new things and to teach somethings to others, and to maybe have some new ideas.
###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summer

###How did you hear about SMT?
residency unlimited

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
My work often takes me down unexplored and surprising avenues. It is exciting for me when I end up with something completely unexpected. I rarely consider any part of my process as a mistake, because in the end, no matter where I go, I have learned and explored something new. Being fully immersed in a community that leaves room for progressive discovery has taught me that the only way to make work is to make work. Period. No matter how seemingly “chaotic” my process gets, my soul is so deeply rooted in a need to have my hands on materials that I cannot stop creating.  
I recently completed my final semester at Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design, and I am eager to break away from institutional ideals.
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
In order to create art, I begin my process by entering into a meditative space, creating small places of order in my studio. Evaluating natural commonalities between these small places, I begin to develop an idea, and then move into the act of editing and clarifying the idea. Said created order can be built alone or collectively. Both approaches are always moving forward, naturally moving into an idea. Editing and clarifying the idea is best done collectively, with many different perspectives from others. Upon clarifying created ideas, work is made. I am always eager to collaborate, our realities depending fully on others.
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
In unifying found objects by color, I strive to set up a scenario that leaves room for my audience to confront their own obsessions with materialism. The Blasphemy Project seeks to address the problematic ways in which culture encourages people to interact. Materials become the means by which we communicate, becoming a substitute for one to one sincere communication of our emotions. Through objects we jump to conclusions about identity, rather than slowly engaging with the newness of the other. In short, objects become proxies for others and control our experiences with others. 
My work is tangible in order to be confrontational. I work to coerce viewers to regard everyday objects in a new light. In this body of work, I am taking objects laden with feminine expectations, altering them into a silhouette of color, and re appropriating them into a substitution for women. The pink I use has a similar level of energy as a bright red, but is less aggressive. In popular media, pink is a color associated with women. In painting these bright pink objects they become a tongue in cheek representation of themselves, amplifying their feminine nature to an even higher level.

###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
I have not experienced a living experience this unique yet in my life. I am eager to experience connection on this level.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
"In my current practice, I have always had a kind of power struggle with my instructors. I want thinkers and collaborators to be able to completely open themselves up to connection, without restraint in regards to hierarchical ""roles"". These roles are made up and set up boundaries between student and instructor, and I wish to break through these boundaries to enter into genuine, open connection and insight. I see this as a fantastic opportunity to do so. 
I am drawn to the Unthinking/Unknowing program as a means to separate myself from the act of thinking in order to enter into meditative creation."

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Hike (A SUMMIT ON A SUMMIT)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
I am an artist living and working in Brooklyn, NY. My background is in sculpture and I really enjoy learning about building and fabrication. For the past 8 years I have worked two dimensionally and the last three years specifically in painting and printmaking. For the past five years I also worked as the Director of a non-profit arts organization in NYC and now work as a freelance grant writer and consultant for artists and organizations. I am also an avid cyclist and take long rides upstate as much as possible. I have a penchant for American History and read a lot of books on various topics of war, Native Americans, slavery and the psychology of killing (as it relates to war and ritual).
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
I rely on collaboration in various ways, but primarily through having a wide range of people through my studio for visits where we talk about art, painting, my paintings and many other things, sometimes only indirectly related to art. The people who participate in studio visits range from artists, curators, galleriest and collectors to writers, musicians, and non-artists. I have collaborated in the past in a more traditional sense that involved equal input on creative and aesthetic fronts. Also, because painting can be a relatively solitary practice, I have side projects I work on making zines and collaborating in a variety of ways using the zine format as the basis for development.
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
In 2009 I collaborated with artist Heather Willems for an outdoor project hosted by Art In Odd Places, NYC. Together we built more than 60 individual letters of the alphabet (50 inches tall) as soft sculptures that were paraded down 14th Street by volunteers and then arranged to spell several different empowering phrases once we reached Union Square. If was a fun project and got more interesting when the public wanted to join in and start spelling their own phrases and words. Below is a website we set up for the project and a link to an interview we did at Union Square.

###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
Art related communal living experiences would include the 3 residency programs I've participated in. Each was very different in the way they were set up and how much interaction was encouraged in each, but in all three the relationships I built during my time there was important and continue today. I really enjoy and benefit from communal environments, but usually due to work, studio and other obligations I dont have much time to devote to nurturing those types of relationships/environments for myself. I would welcome the opportunity to meet new people, learn and share about things and have provocative conversations. I get along easily with others and am generally flexible and have the ability to adapt to new situations well.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
I think that completing a 50 mile hike with a group of interesting people I've never met will be a fun challenge. I'm interested in what I may find along the way, in terms of new things, things I can learn about myself and about others. I think its important to change your environment from time to time and that a disruption in a routine can make room for new things in interesting ways. I deliberately instigate disruptions for myself, however this experience would give me less control over the situation (who is there,where we are, what we're doing) and that interests me.
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)
"My initial thought for a project of this nature, and something dear to me that I could share with a group would be that I could host an ongoing ""storytelling"" event throughout the hike. 
 
 
 I have read an extensive amount on the history of New York City, the whaling industry in the U.S.and the ship wreck of the ESSEX (the story the Moby Dick is written about), abolitionists, the Gold Rush, and much more. I find specific stories related to these topics reveal an intimacy and connection that remove some of the distance between our contemporary selves and the ancestors that created that history. They are also incredibly fascinating stories! I would probably select a story for each night of the hike and research the topics in order to put together a concise story to tell. Each story could be organized in to a category to be considered, i.e. ""The 9 Levels of Hell"" (Dante's Inferno) or ""The 5 Hindrances"" (Buddhist thought)."
###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)

###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
List three new things you've learned in the past year. And one thing you plan to learn.  
 
Last year I learned 1) how to play the ukulele, 2) how to survive massive change in my life 3) how to bake a good biscuit 
 
I want to learn how to do a wheelie.

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
I am a very warm hearted individual. I am hardworking and inquisitive. I swim in the ocean when it’s cold outside. I am buoyant and carry a strong optimism. I look to wonder and possibility. I like to wake up early, early enough, just before the sun gets up because then it is like we are getting up together. I open the curtains and observe the beginning. I like to get outside first thing, check in with the air; most often I do this by bike. I grew up in Watsonville, CA at the bottom of the Santa Cruz Mountains, across from raspberry fields. I moved south as an adolescent and back up north to Olympia for university at The Evergreen State College. This is where I really started to develop my relationship to thinking and making, thinking as a making. Now I live in Oakland, CA where I share house with my partner and 6 other people; I rent and share studio space in Chinatown. My studio is a thinking room. I go here to collect my experiences and perceptions and turn them into questions or remarks. My day jobs are on either sides of Chinatown at a coffee warehouse facility and a farmers market. These places all form a constellation that is my sanctuary.
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
I see my way of thinking and making as collaborative. Not only in the kinds of art that I am producing but also in how I think about what art is. I think about art as something whose value is found in process or in the making. The work that is interesting for me to make is that which is experience oriented or that which exists in the direct engagement of someone with the work. Often times when I am constructing something, I am thinking about a conversation that I want to have and the work becomes the prelude to that conversation as well as evidence of it. Through my practice, I begin to make a trail that weaves in and out of objects and experiences, out of sitting and reading, to drawing and teaching. The practice that I have is kind of like thinking because it is never really over, it is an exploration; it is inquisitive.
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
I recently went to Iceland. I wanted to go to a very isolated place to investigate if you can experience a landscape paying attention to you or if you can only experience a landscape paying attention to itself. This question developed in tandem with a fascination for ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response). Most causes of this sensation are mundane: whispering, chewing, getting a haircut, unpredictable movement, etc. and produce an intense tingling sensation in the back of the neck, on the head, and other places on the body. The sensation is distinctly non-sexual. People are experiencing intense pleasure from watching and engaging in activities where nothing really happens. It is not about the action that is taking place but what state of attention these mundane actions have to offer. There seems to be an underlying practice of empathy that this kind of engagement has to offer. I am drawn to this community that has formed around participation in nothing and I would like to explore what else there is to learn from it.I have been making a series of experiments based on my Iceland adventure and ASMR research. I created a performance in which someone sits down at a table, puts on headphones and is then guided through peeling and cutting a potato. I sit across from them and watch.
###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
I currently live in house with my partner, 6 other people, and Shasta, the dog. All of us are in our mid-twenties to early thirties and are social justice, direct service oriented. We have a big backyard with three raised garden beds. Kevin and I grow a variety of vegetables for the house. We all share food and upkeep responsibilities. We cook for each other and we gather once a month for a meeting. We don’t have a lot of firm cooking/cleaning structures but we all respect the space and each other and our house reflects that. Since moving here 6 months ago, I have really enjoyed the sense of support and care that comes with sharing a living space. At times, I have also found it challenging to live in a social environment where sometimes have to compromise time alone. Ultimately, I feel so lucky to share the space I do with this group of people and for how I continue to grow through the experience.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
The question “How can one make thinking?” is one that drives my practice. At this time in my life, I find that I explore this question and I mostly explore it alone. Since returning to SF Bay Area, I have built a strong community and yet I have struggled to find people who engage in making as a practice of thinking like I do. A lot of the people, artists among them that I have built strong alliances with here, are more material driven in their work. This has been an ongoing challenge for me because of how much I enjoy the exploration and collaborative engagement that comes from discussion and work that is defined by its nature of being unfinished. I largely focus on making thinking and ways of knowing visible and I would strongly benefit from looking at unmaking thinking and making unthinking, etc. 
I am also really drawn to where both teachers-in-residence, Benjamin Korta and Danièle Bourque, are coming from, specifically their respective relationships to Zen and spiritual care. Attention and awareness have been strong guiding principles in my work and I would be interested in working with people whose work is founded in these concepts.
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)

###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)
I would take the work that I have been doing with the ocean and explore it in the context of unthinking/unknowing with the other residents. I would have us all go to the ocean for 2 days and run a series of exercises to practice making the sound of the ocean at different points along the shore; presumably different sounds for different places. At each place we would gather a part of the ocean to bring back with us to the residence. There, we would place our large samples of Atlantic Ocean into big, quiet freezers. When the ocean will have frozen, we would set the different samples in a large room on the floor and sing the sound of the different ocean homes that we had learned from our practice, slowly the sea water would melt and the performers would come to face each other making their respective sounds of the ocean.
###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
At what point is the ocean not the ocean?  
The ocean will always be the ocean, even when it is only salt
###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summer
I don’t foresee any scheduling conflicts. I may like to have a visitor or two.

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
"I am a Mexican artist living and working in New Haven, Connecticut. I received my BA in Fine Art from London Central Saint Martins College of Art & Design. 
 
Although my practice is irrefutably linked to photography, it embraces the sculptural. At its core lies a preoccupation for the photograph’s conflictive nature as both a body in space and an image’s carrier. Moreover, within my work there is always the aim to further understand how information is structured, specifically within visual and physical frameworks, and how we maneuver our way through these information systems. I am interested in the role memory and culture play in our reading of both images and objects, and art production’s relation to this as a gradual reshuffling of cultural forms through their strategic re-use and transformation. 
 
My work has been previously exhibited in several exhibitions throughout London, such as ""Rare Gifts"" at The Residence Gallery (London, 2012), ""TRACE"" at Frameless Gallery (London, 2012), “Inhabited (Flatfile) at Artspace (New Haven, 2013) and “Digital Ground” at Ely Slade House for Contemporary art (New Haven, 2013).etc. In 2011 her work was shortlisted for the BARTUR Award in Photography, and was also shortlisted for the Zeitgeist Open 2012. . Last May I was awarded the Artspace New Haven 2013 Year-long Residency My work has also be featured in Fan the Fire Magazine’s July 2013 issue, Studio Magazine’s Winter 2013 Edition, in the Hartford Courant, amongst others. My work is currently being exhibited as part of Artspace NH’s Crown St Window Project (Feb-March ’14) as well as a within four month project at the Young Men’s Institute (New Haven, CT). Additionally I am now working on curating a show for the YMI’S Gallery, which will open this May."
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
Intellectually my practice is fed by the contemporary art flux and is influence by its context. I find that maintaining a dialogue about my ideas related to my work is key to my thought structuring process. Conversations makeup the intellectual feeding and testing ground for my ideas/projects. Thus, I try to have regular studio visits and I have a weekly skype session with another artist with whom I have collaborated on various joint projects.  
 
I have previously collaborated and shared authorship over larger works and in curating exhibitions. Ei: with Isabelle Gressel, I created the Unhomely Project. This work consisted of a public domestic environment using temporary donations of personal home items and functioned as an art installation. 
 
Likewise, part of my practice seeks to question who is the audience and what is their role, implicating others directly within my work. Ei: In The Postcard Project, people close to me with whom I’ve share an experience, receive (without any prior notice) a post-card with an snapshot of the event, shaping the work and becoming the work’s primary audience. Meanwhile those external to the work must rely solely on the description of the project and their imagination, functioning as a secondary audience.  
 
Similarly, I am currently working on curating a show that will be the end result of an postal art project titled “Por Oaxaca”. Here I have sent a selection artists from different backgrounds/countries a photograph and asked them to respond to the image without any further instructions or information on the photograph. My aim is to question my role as an author of a piece, while incorporating various narrative voices, and question how cultural and social factors affect our reading of a culturally loaded image. Only the artworks produced by the participant artist will be displayed within the exhibition.
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
My current series in progress would very much represent the thought, research, and making process that take place within my practice. This series, titled Maroon Bells and Paradise, plays with fragmenting photography’s materiality, both physical and/or digital. The series is composed of a set of photograms made-up of downloaded, pixilated, and recomposed landscape photographs from notable photographers. In these there is a use of abundant texture and image distortion meant as strategies of reappraising the history of landscape composition, while confronting the viewer with a screen that allows no visual progression into it. Its aim is very much to place the viewer in a state of already knowing (having encountered images in this state of decomposition, as much a landscape images prior to this) conscious or unconsciously, and unknowing given that he can’t make any logical sense of what the image is as a whole. Given that he is presented with a screen of information that contains no given structure to order the viewing experience.  
 
The series aims to play with shared images (abundant in our contemporary media society) and strategies of appropriation. It would also address the contemporary erosion of visual data, contesting the relationship between digital and analogue manipulation. Likewise it looks into the visual and physical frameworks that structure our engagement with reality.  
 
My aims to question the false utopia of access and commonality advertized by contemporary image media. The paradox of the digital and image era is that it ultimately denies us any entry, visual or tactile, into the universe of screens that compose it. We are constantly in a state of knowing/unknowing. The series spotlights our shallow visual reading skills and our contemporary understanding of reality based on a myriad of images in which we have no real presence
###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
Besides having lived with multiple flat-mates and going to summer camp as a kid, was going to boarding school as a teenager was the most intense experience and condensed communal living experience. I went to a co-ed school, where dormitories were male/female only, but we could invite boys over to our ‘living room’. In addition, I had to share my bedroom and the dormitory had communal bathrooms. This meant that we spent all day with a closed group of people sharing every moment from breakfast to afterschool sports, and even field trips to the local cinema. Although the experience was intense, it was very rewarding. I made some long-term friendships there and became much more tolerant and flexible towards others personalities, needs, and beliefs. Furthermore living and going to class with the same group of people benefited my learning process, my friends were more open to discuss school topics as dinner conversations and help out each other in areas one was falling behind. Boarding school became a stepping-stone in my coming of age, helping me gain some independence from family life and shaping myself as an individual within a social context.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
I feel the need to reconsider my processes in relation to my artistic concerns, and how they are understood in and across different social, artistic and intellectual contexts. Being in a collaborative environment with artists across disciplines would open my artistic horizons. The arising conversations will provide a testing ground for my ideas and spur my practice forward. 
Being in such an environment would force me to re-appraise my innate structured thinking and creating logic that seeks to order and accommodate an incessant amount of thoughts. Although I am mentally flexible and can adapt to variety of thinking environments, having a mixture of lecture, physical-psychological exercises, creative and collaborative time will allow me to gain a perspective on my own work which unattainable to me at the moment.  
 
Moreover, the concept of unthinking/unknowing, in relation to that of entry and being held at bay by art as well as an understanding of emptiness and totality (infinite) at one point being equivalent, have been and are prevalent through out my practice.
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)

###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)
I would produce one of the immersive image-environment installations that I have been recently planning. This would be composed of self-standing wooden walls, laid out overlapping each other. These would be placed in the middle of the gallery, emphasizing the work’s sculptural nature and allowing the audience to both walk between the panels and stand back to see the work as a one whole composition. The installation would address the visual and physical frameworks that structure our engagement with space, exploring how art historical notions like perspective and the picturesque have been carried forward through the prevalence of contemporary image-media.  
Likewise, I’ve been thinking of having an image/s printed on curtains. The images would be representations of either landscape or architecture, blown up to almost a 1.1 ratio. Within our contemporary media we constantly engage with ‘image milieus’ where we have no real physical presence – a constant interplay between entry and referral. Printing on curtains would allow the audience to walk through the image, seemingly entering it, while paradoxically emphasizing the surface nature of images. The audience would thus engage on a physical level with the image, spotlighting the images’ dependence on a medium/body and their screen-like presence.
###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
What is a good, note-worthy question to ask and answer? Unfortunately no good question can be given one straightforward answer, at least within my personal thought process. Answers are dependent of the context, the depth of the response, as much as the person answering subjectivity and cultural, socio-economic background. As an artist I enjoy asking unanswerable, hypothetical or rhetoric questions. Questions where multiple answers would be fitting.

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Session A (BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE // RECONSTRUCTING WILDNESS)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
I am a natural creative. Since I was a kid I have been fascinated with playing with materials and drawing. I take great joy in the sense of accomplishment and confidence that I get from making and seeing my ideas come into fruition. it was in my teens that I took on the identity as an artist. Since then I have been working with clay making functional pottery that feels like it has purpose in the world. i also work with wood and make mixed media paintings and collages. I find that i feel most comfortable in the company of other creative people. When friends and i collaborate we form strong bonds and are able to prosper in a special way. I sincerely hope that the activity of making art, which brings me so much joy, can also serve others and be positive and useful contribution to the world.
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
I find that though one person can accomplish much on his or her own, it is almost incomparable to the abilities of a group working together. While I push myself in my own mediums and ideas, time and maturity has taught me that an individual is always susceptible to lack of foresight and tunnel vision. Others can always offer counter opinions and different perspectives. Not to mention that others will be able to fill in the gaps of another's knowledge and skill set. With this in mind I actively pursue collaborators. Also the nature of working with materials small and large scale requires a crew like mentality. A hand is always needed for my work, and a hand is always ready to be lent for others.
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
I would say that my recent work with clay forms that interact with plants would represent me as an artist fit for your program. I think this for two reasons in particular. First is that this work is very much derived from nature. Clay as a material is derived from the earth and conveys the beauty and chaotic order of the natural world. And the second reason pertains to their concepts, all of which deal with the artist working in unison with nature. One series of clay objects was four orbs that are cultivating succulents and presenting them in interesting ways. Another is a series of terrariums that bring bits of nature into an interior space and are presented stylistically as if the housed moss or plant had a unique personality. Another, is a sub-irrigated planter that waters plants through a cotton wick from a well below the soil. Projects I would do in your residency would be ones more feasible to do on site such as drawing/painting or woodcarvings, but I would do them in the same vein as these works in clay. 
 It seems that residents in your program use their interactions with nature to think abstractly. i am very interested in doing this, as well as interacting with others interested in the same thing.

###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
My current living and working situation is an artist collective of sorts. It is a group of like minded individuals who each has their own skills and ideas to bring to the table. though it is often hard to deal with clashing egos, we are always determined to find common ground with each other. With persistent mutual respect, honesty, and support, it seems that we create a kind of magic together.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
I often contemplate issues of nature vs. nurture. I think about what can be said of our true selves. Is it something that lies in our instincts that we are born with? are the values and practices that are cultured within us derived from truth or are they deviations from such? are we moving towards disharmony with nature? or are we functioning in our own natural fashion even if it is expressed destructively or in a synthetic way? A course on reconstructing wildness reads to me as a course in getting in touch with one's primitive roots. I feel that I attempt this in my own work. Being immersed in an environment that is conducive to this process, with others who are looking to do the same, will bring us closer to understanding these issues.
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)
I feel that my specialties lie in materials. I know that the woodland catskills are fertile with a variety of interesting materials that are untouched by the human ego. If given the lead of a workshop I would challenge my peers to use and interact with found materials in their natural state. How can we harmonize ourselves with natural order using the material that comes from the trees, the ground, rocks, the animals, etc? This could be similar to what our ancestors did, or something new and personal. In what ways are the materials that are organic and not synthesized different from man made ones that we interact with everyday and all the time? What feelings do they evoke? We can present crafted items, performances, etc. we can also have discussions about the social implications of these materials and what that says about our own human nature. 
 These are things that I think about in my own work and it would be of interest to me to involve others in this conversation.
###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)
It would have to be something large scale and structural. I often create art that exists within a space, but more and more i think about the space as being the art. I would build something that would coexist with the natural environment and fit within it aesthetically. Ive done work with a post and beam builder in the past, and to me, it is a kind of structural ideal. The wood is an environmentally friendly material and post and beam is simple, strong, and beautiful. I could see myself constructing a post and beam structure that the viewer can interact with by actually being inside. It could be large enough to fit within and small enough to be intimate and able to be made in a timely manner.
###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
How can we find meaning in a meaningless world? 
 
Create it.

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Hike (A SUMMIT ON A SUMMIT), Session A (BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE // RECONSTRUCTING WILDNESS)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
I live in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, with my wife, our daughter and dog. I make sound, sculptural and musical artworks. In addition to being an artist, I work as a librarian. For as long as I can remember, I have always wanted to be an artist. My father was a hobby painter. I grew up in a semi-rural small town in Ontario Canada. Being outside and close to nature has always been important to me. I like camping and hiking. I also like cooking, traveling, drinking beer in pubs, drinking wine at friend's places, drinking coffee in cafes, watching movies with my wife, going for walks with my daughter, walking my dog, reading, listening to music, listening to music loud in my living room and dancing with my wife and daughter (the dog doesn't understand dancing). I like all kinds of music. I like all kinds of art. I think art and music are of the greatest and most hopeful things that people can do, which is why I keep doing it.
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
I have been involved with a few collaborative projects, particularly with making music. I find collaborative experiences to be very generative and rewarding. The more sculptural work that I am doing now is not highly collaborative but there are elements: I prefer to work in an group/social studio space and have colleagues around to discuss ideas, art and the world around us. I find my ideas develop when I've been talking about them. When I am working on a major project, I likewise prefer to have people around me to give input (and a helping hand) and this always ends up influencing the art I make. I do have one fully collaborative project that I am involved with currently, which is an extension of a project started ten years ago. A friend and I started making noise-music together with a freeform, totally improvised, process driven approach. Back then we were next door neighbours, now we live on different continents and the project is based on trying to maintain this improvised approach through technology.
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
The Pink Glass Swans was the noise band that I started with a friend mentioned above. Our goal was to work within a very minimal framework to allow for, as much as possible, a totally free-improvised sound at the borders of noise and music. This was achieved through an agreed upon process, which had the effect of stopping any discussion of what we were making and to focus only making in the moment and only communicating through making. The framework was represented by the situation: a medium sized room containing a robust array of sound intoning objects and amplifying devices ranging from the conventional (guitars), the novel (kids toys), the quotidian (pots and pans), and the specialized (electronic effects processors); a routine- meeting every week at around the same time for about the same amount of time; and a way of documenting (usually a cassette recorder). The process followed a set of “rules”: anyone can make this music, any object that can be used to make sound can be used, nothing is decided beforehand, listen and respond to what you hear, and play it loud. We invited people to joins us, some regulars others only once or twice, and what happened was everyone present just started, either clapping or strumming or banging or turning on and off a radio and then for the next few hours the sound would build in waves as patterns developed and dissolved, and as people freely moved around the room picking something up or plugging something in and playing it until something urged them to change. The recording was an important part of the “noise jam” and often we would listen to the entire recording right away in order to reflect on what was made. At the time of this project I was influenced by free jazz, and in particular the political ideals of anarchy and freedom embodied in the music, and also the spiritual aspects of the music. The Pink Glass Swans project was for me one of the most influential artmaking experiences of my life. http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Glass+Swans
###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
As part of travelling, my wife and I have volunteered on farms (through the WWOOF organization). One such experience in Italy had about ten of us living together in one barn/loft, eating large communal meals and working together in the fields. We were there for two weeks. It was all organized by the host so we didn't have to plan much, just how to be together. We had a wonderful time. I also think of sharing studio space as a type of communal living, which I have been doing on and off for ten years or so.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
I do not know how the hike will aid my artistic development, which is why I like the idea. I do know that I find it productive to walk and think, also I find it beneficial to go and come back. I like the doing aspect of this hike- planning, traveling, walking, talking, meeting new people- a departure, which at this time is something I am seeking, but not just any trip, I am seeking something which brings a dedicated focus to thinking about my art practice and discussing/experiencing it with other likeminded seekers in hopes of finding something new, something yet unthought of. I will bring a portable audio recorder with me and these recordings could potentially be the basis of a new artwork. 
Reconstructing Wildness has a similar appeal, however I'm imagining this departure will lead to a very different part of the woods. Part of my attraction to noise is the wildness of it; the way you can submerge yourself in it, lose yourself in it. This is a rare experience. I am very interested in exploring self-transcendence in different ways and connecting it to ideas of wildness is very intriguing. Religious experience and expression has been a long time interest of mine and I have been recently been thinking about transcendence, especially in relation to religious practices which focus on mind-body-self connection. I have experimented with meditation, yoga and chakra opening to limited degrees, as I always find a disconnect between these established practices and the modern world. The complexity and contradiction of seeking spirituality within modernity has recently been influencing my art. I think there is a connection with this line of thinking and the direction proposed for Reconstructing Wildness.
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)
Following R. Murray Schafer, who developed many of the ideas of what is known as acoustic ecology, I will lead a workshop on structured listening. This will involve a brief talk on acoustic ecology, reading a bit of Schafer's writing and then proceeding as a group to follow some of the listening exercises designed by him. The most well known of Schafer's exercise is the sound walk, which is a focused listening of an environment experienced by moving through it, and is often followed up with a discussion of what was heard.
###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)
I envision a SMT session in immersive sound and listening. One aspect would be noise making- setting up a situation for free improvisation with musical instruments and other sound making devices and amplifiers and microphones. Also listening workshops like sound walks, as described above. Another aspect could be something influenced by sound therapy and how sound vibration is used in healing- creating immersive sound environments/situations for the purpose of immersive listening, but also to work with participant's practices, such as creating sound for a performance, or sound to go with painting.
###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
What are a few things influencing your thoughts and art making recently? Installation artist Mike Nelson, composer Terry Riley, Tibetan Buddhism, psychedelia, the 1970s, aesthetics, Godzilla movies, listening to my music collection on random, J. G. Ballard short stories, early abstract painting, walking through the city.
###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summer
There is nothing as far as scheduling conflicts, however I may wish to schedule a departure mid way through to meet with my wife and daughter, or they could come visit me. My daughter is one and half years old and I would find three weeks to be a long time to be away from my family.
###How did you hear about SMT?
Online through searching for art residencies (but I forget which website in particular) or the instant coffee listserv
###What sorts of foods do you not eat? What foods are you allergic to?
I do not have any specific restrictions or allergies but as much as possible I prefer to eat whole foods, naturally/organically raised, no preservatives... that kind of thing.

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
I'm a queer art lady, who is pretty into comics, storytelling, mythology and fantasy. I'm a lovable Leo sign, who is loyal and respectful. Last year I did a lot of drawing, note taking and thinking. This year I want to draw/write some comics, but I also have a bunch of performances lined up.  
I am pretty focused on making art these days, but I also have to deal with surviving capitalism, systematic oppression, etc. and that can cut into my creative energies. I'd like to be able to cut off these concerns for a few weeks, hang out with smarty pants art folk and soak in the wilderness at the Yellow House.
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
I have been doing various media projects with queer folks: coordinating the Slippery Slope Cabaret, hosting a radio show/ interviewing trans*artists and activists, and engaging in the youtube community. Interacting with people and having meaningful conversation inspires my practice as a writer and thinker.  
Of course, my social interactions can also be full of hilarious misunderstandings or micro-aggressions that are just as inspiring to my art and thinking. Queerness and social critique is a large part of my practice.
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
[http://morgansea.wordpress.com/performance-work/super-powers-the-slide-show/](http://morgansea.wordpress.com/performance-work/super-powers-the-slide-show/) 
 
It’s a piece that talks about my trans experience and queer politics with the question, “Which super power would you choose and why?” It gets pretty funny as, during the performance, I have a sort of existential crisis trying to find out if I am more into Shapeshifting or Telepathy. With shapeshifting, I could be as visually appealing as I wanted to be, gain various degrees of privilege, and explore amazing possibilities with a super-fluid queer body. With telepathy, I could change people’s minds and subtly shift their social-political views with persuasive comments that cater to their subconscious. However, could I trust myself not to straight up re-write their brain? What are the consent issues involved in telepathy? Which would I choose now? I still don’t know. Scratch that, shapeshifting, totally.
###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
I attended SMT in 2012. I really enjoyed the cooking, the conversation, and the creative peoples. I’ve also lived with a lot of roommates and generally aim to please within a communal space.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
Session B, Unthinking/Unknowing sounds really good to me. The physicality of the Bourque's class sounds like a good way to break from my urban habitual laze and enter the space with an active body and mind. 
The unthinkable makes me think concepts or ideas that have become unspeakable, removed from societies lexicon. This seems like a good thing to meditate on an add to my queer theory toolkit in my ongoing battle with hegemonic oppression!  
I'm excited to explore Deleuzian concepts and think Bourque's background experience teaching contemporary mythology would benefit my own practice which often queers ancient mythology, archetypes, and contemporary mythology.
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)

###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)
I would like to make a series of short videos or photographic essays exploring the hierarchy of Daedalus and the Minotaur . (Daedalus the greek mythological inventor not only built the apparatus for the Cretian Queen to mate with a bull, he also designed the Labyrinth that the beast man would spend his life in. Additionally supplying a special thread that would help Theseus navigate the Labyrinth and kill the Minotaur once and forall.) My vision would see the Minotaur set free in the Catskills. Daedalus and his son Icarus performing a wax dripped S&M practice. And giving unlimited funding, the creation of a stone maze for meditation.
###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
What does this open-ended question remind you of? 
I’m standing soaking wet in front of a store clerk in Williamsburg. She thinks I should be embarrassed, and I am but only because there’s no easy way to explain that I feel great. 
It’s hard to explain in a couple sentences how two weeks in the catskills had affected me. How in touch with my body and nature I felt, only to feel the violent contrast on a nauseating bus ride back to NYC. I was worried that connection was gone, but a 6 block walk in a warm thunderstorm felt fantastic and reminds me of a feelings I still can't describe.
###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summer
Both Session A and B sound amazing, but I will be busy in June between the Philly Trans Health Conference and Encuentro 2014 Conference. 
 
So far July is completely open for me, so there should be no problems with Session B.

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Hike (A SUMMIT ON A SUMMIT)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
I am a contradicting, well behaved, adventurous, uncertain, brief, efficient, un-hierarchical, chance-loving, unarticulated, optimistic, designer, dabbler, artist, jokester, service industry worker, non-theatrical performer, Minneapolis College of Art and Design graduate and list maker based in Portland, Oregon.
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
My work is not bound by medium, but by method. I work within boundaries based on a conceptual logic, submitting to patterns and structures that exist naturally. I search for and collect connections and contradictions. I misuse materials and re-appropriate objects. I engage in futile gestures to provoke confusion, seeking out the awareness that occurs through redundancy and subverted functionality. I question when and where art really exists. I collaborate with groups of people as an instigator and facilitator. I challenge cliches and play games with words. I build the box and ask for others to step out of it.
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
One of my most recent artistic endeavors has been teaching. Last summer I taught a process and idea generation class for 9 to 12 year olds at the Rochester Art Center in Minnesota. While the class at the RAC was for young students, the projects and class structure are similar to activities that I would like to facilitate with adults. I like to act as an amateur teacher, a teacher that knows less than the students. I pose questions with no answers and instigate conversation. The project at the RAC examined a playful logic and encouraged students to draw conclusions and make connections between seemingly unlike things, while working within a given set of restrictions.  
My curating project, POWERPOINT, also represents my system of working within a set of invented boundaries. For this exhibition I solicited works by artists and non-artists created using only PowerPoint. The show resulted in a collection of 2D images, animations, slide shows, sculptures and books. The boundaries set by the program brought limitations that, through operation, provoked a consciousness of the making process and ultimately dictated the product.
###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
Aside from living with roommates throughout college, I have attended summer camp, worked as a summer camp counselor, and volunteered on farms, all of which I was living with and sharing space with others. The most communal living experience I have had was volunteering on farms in Minnesota, Holland and Belgium, where I contributed daily to the homestead by cooking, cleaning, building, and working in the gardens and fields along the other volunteers and farmers.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
I believe the collaborative and kinetic nature of the School of Making and Thinking would have an extremely positive impact on my practice. Summit on a Summit, specifically, would be a beautiful opportunity to challenge myself physically, observe myself , learn from others and escape my everyday. On the hike, I would hope to challenge my improvisation skills, and focus on becoming more aware of the moments that I enter a most thoughtful state of mind.
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)
Making Assumptions & Drawing Conclusions Workshop: 
We will each choose a random object found in nature. These objects will become our readymades for which we would generate a title and artist statement/manifesto/description/poem. Based only on what we can glean from the found object we will assign it meaning and determine it's function as an art object. Our tools would be signs and symbols, metaphors and analogies. We would conclude the workshop with a presentation and conversation about the works.
###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)
"I would like to do a series of small interventions, experiments and exercises with others and by myself that respond to and question the environment. I am unsure if this would result in a ""final product"" or if it would exist as a continuous performance of sorts. My project would hopefully represent the group as a whole and the individuals within."
###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
Q: Is this art?  
A: I don't know.
###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summer
I do not have any scheduling conflicts this summer.

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Hike (A SUMMIT ON A SUMMIT)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
Born and raised in Montreal, I am presently completing a Master of Fine Arts at the School for Contemporary Arts, Simon Fraser University, in Vancouver. Prior to undertaking my MFA, I completed an MA at the Centre for Drama, theatre and Performance Studies, University of Toronto, in 2012. My research and creative practice explores identity and belonging, juggling with my experience as an interdisciplinary artist/researcher/human being in an increasingly homogenized society.  
 
The focus of my artistic practice lies in willess acts of self-affirmation around space (public and private), time, and identity. I am interested in revisiting place by reconfiguring our conception and use of space in the everyday through scored and task-oriented actions. The body becomes the site for my exploration, while repetition, endurance and resistance test the physical and emotional boundaries of my corporeal matter. Working at the edges of discomfort and vulnerability, I continuously re-evaluate the threshold of my body as it breaks down and rebuilds to become a site for change and exchange. I perform the friction of skin against architecture and nature. My hope is to generate knowledge through acts that most have discarded as unfeasible, unthinkable, and absurd. Embodying text and challenging language are fundamental to addressing identity and posing critical perspectives on authority. 
 
I am a long distance runner and I am a lover of the outdoors. When not focusing on my research and practice, I enjoy all types of physical activity and exertion. Throughout my life I have actively participated in team sports since they fulfill my need for exchange and community while practicing physical exercise. In the past three years, I have sought opportunities to bridge my practice/research with my enthusiasm for the outdoors through play and collaborative endeavors in mobile residencies. I enjoy combining my academic background and intellectual capacities with the practicalities of everyday living – to take part in the communal exchange of experience and idea based activities.
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
My creative/intellectual practice is in constant oscillation between spaces of extensive collaboration and focused individual isolation. Collaboration allows me to explore and expand my practice beyond its natural scope. As an artist and thinker, I recognize my intellectual and physical limitations and in doing so actively seek others to help me develop new methods of information creation. Within a collaborative exchange, I find ways to immerse myself in environments (be it urban or rural) that would be otherwise entirely foreign to me. 
 
My interests lie in collaboration as a means of emergence – allowing group dynamics within a variety of settings to inform, transform and guide my practice and that of others. I believe in cohabitation as a means of furthering knowledge in a project, of letting time unfurl as dynamic practice-based encounters reveal new patterns in the bodies and minds of each collaborator. I am interested in the idea of community building in order to transport the encounters beyond their initial framework. My process is about sharing – creating rhyzomatic matrixes of connections and experiences with other bodies in space. In order to do so, I open up my projects to the greater public, inviting them to contribute, challenge, and transform its course according to their own life experience. I enter every project in anticipation that it will somehow, at some point, leave my hands to become molded by the minds of others. 
 
I must also acknowledge that there are times when the collaborative act becomes one of tension in my work. In these times, when ideas collide and actions oppose, I find myself to be the most amazed at what can emerge from individuals not meshing. The balance between my own practice and others begins to blur in these instances, and so we begin an important process of negotiation and communication.
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
In SHUTTLE (Summer 2013) I joined a group of international artists, designers, performance makers and researchers in a journey through the deserts of the American south-west performing an exploration of the aesthetic, political, cultural and environmental resonances of desert ecologies. As a temporary travelling community, our interests were in movement, environment, and performance. Our work consisted of generating new creative practices and works that shuttled between registers of the known and unknown by exploring performances of mobility. Journeying through seminal land arts works, ancient settlements, desert conditions, and spaces of transit, we performed daily actions creating ephemeral conditions and generating encounters. Our experience took us through an initial and closing event in Tucson, Arizona, and a five-day performance at Performance Studies International (Psi 19) conference at Stanford University in Paolo Alto. We travelled close to four thousand miles from Tucson and back in a white Chevrolet van moving through the Sonoran, Great Basin and Mojave Deserts. 
 
SHUTTLE explored notions of creative and everyday cohabitation that have prepared and made me seek out more collaborative laboratories that allow for an intense and condensed period of exchange to occur. The constant process of negotiation between each individual of the group, the attempts and desire to fulfill both collective and personal goals, as well as the commitment to each other to hold a communal practice shared by all made for an intense environment of mobile performance and dialogue. The final product of the project was part collaborative and part individual. However, a clear overlap and strong influence occurred between the participants pushing the boundaries of each other’s work in different directions.
###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
During the summer of 2013, I spent two months at Nes Artist Residency in Skagastrond, Iceland. During this time, I shared a family-sized home with three people. Spending most of our days in this space, our group developed a strong relationship with each other that manifested itself through cooking, eating, working, and playing together. Each night of the week a different member of the household cooked a meal, with the rest of the group contributing to its preparation. We used this time to exchange ideas about work and more importantly to discover things about the other people. In the evening, we often played games, usually suggested and organized by a different person each night. These served not only to strengthen our bond as a group of artists living together, but also contributed to the works being created during the daytime. We also began exploring notions of collaboration together. Although nothing complete transpired, our exchanges provided fertile ground for creative stimulation. 
 
In SHUTTLE, every aspect of the trip revolved around communal living. The group slowly began to work as a well-oiled machine as tasks and responsibilities became divided within the group. Many have remarked since the end of the trip that the act of everyday living (communally) was the very essence of the collaboration.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
My interest in applying to the hike this summer stems from a desire to return and continue exploring notions of mobile collaboration and performance within a natural setting. As a city dweller, I find it necessary to regain contact with nature whenever I can. This challenges my practice and thinking to move out of its habitual relationship to the spatial structure of the urban context and to adapt itself to a different setting. My daily practice often relies on the concrete structures that I dwell and evolve in. These formations become points for me to anchor my physical actions and critical thinking. Outside of the city, living of a packsack and subjected to the power of nature, I develop new and different perspectives and physical actions that would not manifest themselves otherwise. My hope is to break with the monotonous and cyclical behaviour of urban living by immersing myself in a natural context where thinking and doing manifest themselves differently and out of necessity. 
 
I am also hoping that the hike, in its collaborative and cohabitation structure, will aid in developing my individual practice and give way to a collective bond. My desire is to take part in a community experience that will expand beyond the session – to make contacts and relationships that will begin to inform further exchanges. As an artist who works through a critical embodiment of space and place my work will inevitably become shaped by the minds and anatomies of those who will participate in the hike. Hopefully, I can bring others into my process and lend myself to theirs in order to develop a dialogue. 
 
The hike, in its relationship to the Central Catskills offers a chance to explore a geographical region that I have grown up driving through and had little firsthand contact with. My hope is to engage the region as a thinker, creator, and human being in order to become more knowledgeable about its ecological structure and habitat.
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)
The workshop I would most likely want to lead during the hike revolves around a series of actions that I have recently developed with an at-risk high school youth group. The workshops reflect on notions of collective walks as spaces of potential insurrection and change. In their current form, they combine immersive lectures and workshops, drawing from art history, popular culture, an embodied practice, and notions of play. 
 
The proposed work involves bringing members of the hike together with a one-meter rope. A direct reference to Linda Montano and Tehching Hsieh’s One Year Performance 1983-1984 (Rope Piece) where the two artists tied themselves with a one-meter rope for an entire year. The workshop explores the physical and psychological manifestation of ‘being tied or roped’ together. What emerges is an interesting collective effort as individuals negotiate being bound together and fulfilling certain tasks/needs in their immediate environment. The workshop would also include a lecture portion where historical precedents for this type of bondage is exhibited, therefore furthering the intellectual exercise of understanding the act being performed. I would anticipate beginning the workshop with groups of two being bound, and slowly work our way until the whole group is tied together thus forming a collective body. The performative actions and thinking that would develop would inevitably be linked to the natural environment we evolve in. The workshop would take this setting into consideration and adapt to the space in order to connect gestures and actions back to the site.
###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)

###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
How does it feel to ascribe to a ‘global’ art system? A striking issue in applying for international residencies is that the mode of life that has developed around them is one of privilege. The 21st century ‘mobility’ of the artist figure is an issue that I am interested in, and struggle with regularly. As a Canadian and son of two professionals, I am aware that the movement I follow is in great part a product of my socio-economic standing rather than a sign of a ‘true’ democratic global art system whereby artists can travel freely and participate in residencies. It is this sense of unease in mobility that brings me to ground myself, to look for self-aware communities of artists who recognize their local environment and respect it.

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Session A (BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE // RECONSTRUCTING WILDNESS)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
I am a female watercolorist who paints flowers, trees, cats, and moons. While I hate the way that sounds, I like the way it looks. By both honoring and critiquing work of this nature, I make comments on the tradition of “Sunday Afternoon Painters”. My subject matter can be read as sentimental, but I see it as a recording of time. The sun is setting, the moon is moving, and the flowers are dying. How one brush stroke leads to the next is more important to me that the subject matter—the subject matter is just the vehicle to get me from point A to point B. For me, it all comes back to paint on paper. In a current series of paintings, the circle in the form of the moon, sun, streetlights, and balloons formally ties the work together. My work involves a vigorous studio practice, painting everyday. At times, I paint outdoors in plein air on hikes and back packing trips. At night, I paint in my car utilizing my moon roof to capture the night sky. I am trying to reach nature from an unnatural place. My work is a recording of the suburban landscape.  
 
On a less formal note, I am a navy brat who has lived in more houses than years I have been alive. I have a one-eyed dog and two cats. Currently, I am finishing up my last semester of grad school in sunny and humid Tampa, Florida, looking ahead to the next adventure.
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
While I still love the romanticized vision of the artist alone in their studio, for me, it’s not a realistic one. My creative practice is collaborative mostly in the sense that I depend on an audience for critique and feedback on an idea or a body of work in progress. I find discussing the ends and outs of particular idea helpful for my own process. In order for my work to be effective I want to find out what is working both visually and conceptually. A collaborative audience provides that valuable feedback to aid in making my creative process stronger. Having been in graduate school for the past three years, I have received this collaboration though the institution of academia. Now that I am leaving academia, I want to search out this richness in conversation from new sources. In addition, I also collaborate within an artist collective called EyeSplice, featuring twelve artists around the country and South America. Together we have formed a network to exhibit together, provide critiques, and work on our professional development. We have upcoming shows in Long Island City, NY and Tampa, FL. Working with this group provides me with support and accountability. We hold each other up to certain standards and look out for opportunities that would benefit one another or the whole group. Again, while the lone artist may be a romantic vision, it’s an impractical one. As artists/thinkers supporting one another leads to richer work and lives.

###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
While most nights were not spent sleeping there, I feel my graduate school studio provided one of my many communal living experiences. When you’re spending an average of eight or more hours a day in a shared space, it becomes a community, or at least it should. Luckily for me, my experience led to a wonderful exchange of ideas, supplies and support. When I needed advice, someone was usually there to take a look at a piece or bounce an idea off of. When I ran out of something, there was a chance someone had some more. Most importantly, in the moments I doubted myself, one of my colleagues provided with me with support to keep me going. I was also there to provide the same for my studio mates. While the studio wasn’t my actual home, the sense of community there made it feel like one.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
The theme of this course is what first brought me to apply to The School of Making Thinking. Recently, I had a discussion with my mentor and professor Elisabeth Condon about my work’s approach to the natural through the unnatural. Like the Tonalist before me, my work is in part a reaction to the industrialization and suburbanization of the natural world. In a way, my work is a survey of the suburban landscape. Part of my reasoning for painting outdoors in natural spaces allows me an attempt at connecting with the natural world and recording this attempt with paint on paper. However, unlike the Tonalist, there is an unnatural quality to my work, too far removed from the natural state. This is why I am interested in exploring whether or not it’s possible to reconnect with The Wild.
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)

###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)
I would like to remain as open as possible at this point in order to fully benefit from the experience of the residency, although I can confidently envision painting as the main aspect of the project. I believe being able to explore the area, as you state—socially, intellectually, and environmentally will inspire new work much in the same way that Florida has. I imagine spending a lot of time outdoors painting and pondering.
###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
What the best thing you’ve ever won? 
 
When I was in the sixth grade, we lived in Hawaii in military housing. I went to a dance at the recreation center and bought a raffle ticket. I won a ride on a submarine—that was yellow! My parents kept making jokes and reciting Beatles lyrics in the weeks between winning and going. I got to see an octopus crawling along the ocean floor. It’s one of my most vivid memories.

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
I am a filmmaker and musician, but recently mostly a filmmaker. I'm very passionate about experimental narrative filmmaking and I think about it all the time. In my day to day life, I live in Brooklyn and I'm playing it by ear. I write a lot: mostly absurd/surreal narratives. I spend a lot of time working on films and music videos, and also helping friends make their own things. I like comedy and laughing and making people laugh. I'm also really interested in experimental comedy, especially irony - and maybe also kind of shock humor and vulgarity as they related to absurdity? I don't know.
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
Is it okay if I'm not sure? I like to have conversations and talks with other people about art and philosophy, because I just find it really stimulating. I'm very interested in acting and improvisation and empathy, both creatively and personally. But there's also part of me which likes to be alone to write and kind of be really private.

###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
Other than co-habitating with other people in dorms and apartments, I'm not sure what else would qualify. I've shared chores before, cooked for other people, slept in the same room as roomates. I have camping experience. I'm an Eagle Scout. I am open to trying new things.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
I have always been interested in meditation, ever since my dad taught me to meditate at an early age. I am fascinated by an artistic practice that seeks zen moments of creativity, in which artistic will is able to flow free and unobstructed. And I guess the flip side of the coin is that when I'm not actively creating, I spend a lot of time thinking, mulling things over, self-analyzing.
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)

###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)
I am interested in experimenting with an artistic process that merges writing and creating with personal ritual and spirituality. I'd like to structure my days of writing with rituals like meditation and physical movement interspersed throughout, and make the conscious choice to engage with these rituals spiritually and existentially. I am curious about how that will affect my writing and my experience of writing and my experience of living - especially because in urban NYC I feel like I rarely engage with any spirituality or personal ritual. I'd maybe even hope to stage scenes from this writing with other people at SMT to feel out how they work, and whether a ritualistic writing process might yield a different performance process for an actor/collaborator.
###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW? I'm standing at this standing desk I made by placing a box that used to hold a vacuum cleaner on top of my regular desk in my room. I'm re-reading this application and nitpicking my responses to the questions. I'm absentmindedly looking at a Gustav Klimt calendar beside my desk and considering that in a couple days I'll need to turn the page on the calendar to display MARCH and wondering what that will look like. I'm ruminating on whether reading this response will seem cloying or banal. I'm hypothesizing that it will be okay, but I guess maybe I wouldn't put a whole lot of money on it.

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
Since graduating from university in 2011, I’ve been trying to re-learn how to make art like I did before I had a degree in Art. I don’t want to unlearn what I learned in school, because much of it was valuable to my intellectual development and creative practice. Rather, I’m trying to re-inhabit the state of inhibition that I remember occupying before all of the high concept and theory. In my ideal state, I’m able to create in a way that is unencumbered and fluid, and my creative mind is in constant dialogue (verging on unified) with my critical mind. Much of what I internalized about artistic discipline through higher education has formed an obstacle to the act of creation. Bit by bit, I am disintegrating that obstacle and allowing myself to play, enjoy not knowing, and let go of outcome expectations. 
 
In order to achieve equilibrium, the next big step in my life is to find the right physical place and space to occupy and call home. This is essential. At the moment, I feel like I’m drifting through the sea, not in a huge hurry, not exactly sure where I’m headed, only certain that I’m going wash up onto the shore somewhere new. Over the past few years I’ve split my time between the Bay Area of California and the Research Triangle of North Carolina. In a couple of days, I depart for Iceland for a two-month residency in Reykjavík. When I return, the next move I make will be to my new home, and I’m excited about that. I just need to figure out where it will be.  
 
Rather than a biographic summary, this is me now, putting one foot in front of the other until I arrive.
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
Conceptually, I consider all creative and intellectual work to be collaborative. Whether drawing, performing live, or writing a research paper, each expression is influenced and by all of the things I have learned, read, seen, heard, discussed, felt, and understood prior to the moment of expression. Any artist is in a collaborative relationship with the world around them at all times, and this relationship includes current events, media, trends in art, peers, creative partners, professional expectations, financial obligations, available materials, available work space, etc. Not only are the ideas that I have a result of my collaboration with the world around me, but the way my ideas manifest (and even which ideas I am able to manifest) depends greatly on who I am, what I have to work with, where I am, and when I’m doing it. I depend on collaboration at every moment.  
 
Actually, I collaborate with many peer artists. I view my network of fellow creatives as a resource for mutual support and growth. Since 2009, I have been working with a group called The Performance Collective, which I helped found in Chapel Hill, NC during my time as an undergraduate. Our work is original, devised, experimental performance, which we develop through a process of ideation based on sharing, exchange, and improvisation. It is in this process that I developed not only the capacity to work with other artists, but the ability drop my focus on authorship, say yes, and co-create. This experience has undoubtedly been a benefit across the board in my life. Besides TPC, I have done collaborative projects, from building renovations to essays, with many groups, including Rock Paper Scissors Collective (Oakland), Signify Sanctify Believe! (LA), the Xhurch (Portland), Girltown (multi-city), The Queer Explorer’s Club (NYC / Greensboro, NC), Queerlab (Greensboro, NC) and Elsewhere (Greensboro, NC).
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
The 2012/2013 project I created with The Performance Collective members Brian Hicks and Larissa Kaul called “(YOU YOURSELF WE WE ARE ARE WE) EVEN HERE <?” was all about asking and answering questions related to gender, identity, and performance. We began with a set of questions about queerness and art and knew we wanted to turn the exploration of these questions into a performance. Over the course of three months, we did writing exercises, improvisational movement research, had many discussions, and turned our thoughts into images, sequences, and eventually a show. Not every project I do takes the form of an hour-long performance, but the process tends to be similar, starting with questions and using whatever media I am focusing on to express my thoughts, answers, and sometimes even the questions themselves.  
 
I like to make art that is political, but not polemical. I imagine that the best thing a piece of (political) art can do is confuse someone who thinks they already know the answer. Art can / should ask questions and start / participate in conversations. I try to use creative processes and critical research processes interchangeably, so that art projects become an educational experiment. Each project is ultimately about learning something or at least understanding it better than when I started. I believe that this approach is very much in line with SMT’s pursuit to, “expand traditional notion[s] of thinking.” Academia encourages you to have a thesis that you can support with other people’s previous work or a hypothesis that you seek to prove. This approach can be valuable, but when you’re looking for something specific, you’re likely to miss other things that are there. The practice I have described is more of an attempt to travel through questions without a destination in mind.
###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
As an undergraduate, I was part of a co-ed literary and arts society called St. Anthony Hall. We had a house, which was a residence for (give or take) seven people, but a part-time home for anywhere between twenty and thirty. I lived there for a little over two years. Luckily, it was an overall positive experience, but it was full of challenges, compromises, and lessons. In addition to simply sharing space, we coordinated regular chapter meals, shared cleaning responsibilities, and undertook projects on campus and in the community together. In hindsight, I’m always proud of how well we organized it all, even if it was chaotic on the surface. As a member of The Hall (as we called it) I learned that clear communication and a constructive, cooperative attitude are essential to the mental health of everyone involved. I have numerous friends who have had negative communal living experiences, both in coops and normal multi-roommate houses. In all of these situations a lack of communication and/or bad attitudes were the culprit(s). We had some rough times at The Hall, but we did a great job of trusting and supporting each other while identifying the problems and dealing with them.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
I’m drawn to “Unthinking / Unknowing” because, as I began to explain in my “About Me” section, I am currently in the process of undoing certain aspects of my higher education training in an attempt to re-learn ways I was working creatively before then. The idea that, “Thinking is always something that happens when we are least prepared, unexpecting, unknowing,” resonates with me deeply. This is something that I do my best to lean into in my artistic practice. The content of this session is related to conceptual interests of mine (especially Deleuze and also the work of Paolo Friere) and will use methods I am comfortable with and greatly enjoy (especially physical and meditation practices). I am excited about the combination of physical, textual, and internal approaches described in the session information, because it seems to parallel the type of process that I have undertaken in the development of prior work, especially performance. This is a unique opportunity to engage in this type of process with a group of completely new people and without the purpose of creating a performance at the end of it all. What else could come out of this work? I am eager to find out! As I said in the above section, when we are looking for a specific outcome, we miss other possibilities. In lieu of working towards a performance, there is great potential for something I have not even imagined to manifest, which is very exciting to me. Finally, from what I have read about SMT, the exchange between / among “teachers” and “students” seems to be much more symbiotic than in a traditional learning environment. I feel like this is a session that I will not only benefit from attending, but to which I will be able to make meaningful contribution.
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)
I am not applying to the Hike.
###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)
At SMT I would challenge myself to do something outside of, or at least not primarily focused in, my normal repertoire, which would be some sort of devised or improvised performance, probably involving a video or other visual art element. I’ve been leaning toward the medium of sound lately, and that is a skill set I want to develop further. Given unlimited funding, I’d invest in recording tools and production equipment, and focus my energies to this end. In keeping with SMT's encouragement of intermedia projects, I’d seek ways to activate and incorporate a variety of media and creative / critical strategies. I've recently been very interested in how contemporary technology, such as mobile devices - laptops, cell phones, tablets, etc. - and the Internet can be used in live performance, activated for audience participation, etc. These tools that we interact with constantly are primarily used for information, but I want to explore the potential of their non-intended uses, especially as sonic instruments. This relates to the session to which I'm applying in that engaging with technologies in this way requires a certain amount of purposeful forgetting / unknowing the assumed rules and boundaries of these tools.
###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
"What is your aspiration in life? Like Beyoncé says in ""Pretty Hurts,"" my aspiration in life is to be happy, but what does that look like? For me, a young artist doing my best to carve out a sustaining creative career, happiness looks like being debt-free, having a place (maybe separate places) where I can comfortably work and live, being able to support myself and the people I love with my work, and doing work that not only pays the bills but that is constructive, innovative, and inspirational to as many people as possible."
###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summer
I have no current plans for the months of May-July.
###How did you hear about SMT?
Elsewhere, Etc. Facebook Group
###What sorts of foods do you not eat? What foods are you allergic to?
I am vegetarian, but I do occasionally eat fish.

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Hike (A SUMMIT ON A SUMMIT)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
I woke up dreaming of the next world and then I went to sleep and dreamed of the world that came after that. Then satellites lowered by degrees and I used them to look through a building. Then I woke. Then I fell asleep again. Then I found myself in a place I didn't know, in the bottom of a building near the boiler, with people who didn't belong to me. Then I belonged to them. Then I looked through the eyes of a satellite. Then I looked through the eyes of a CTV. Then I looked through someone's cell phone. I also remember a train: a train carting satellites to a satellite graveyard. I remember salvaging them and launching them back into orbit. One day, seeing through a satellite will be as common as looking through a camera. One day, seeing through someone else's eyes will be as simple as making a phone call. One day, I decided I could not be invisible, so I would have to plug myself in, as deep as it is possible. At a certain point, I thought I was becoming something ancient, like a figure repeated across paintings in a museum, marching across epochs, but actually, I was only becoming a machine. I installed a series of LEDS beneath my skin and walked across the snow, opening a security protocol, so people could use my body like lantern, or a marquee.
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
Hm. Pretty much in every way. In Saito, we work as a team: two poets, one programmer, one cinematographer and one graphic designer. For Saito, I'm the creative lead, so it's collaborative, but I have the final say. In Eco-Hacker, it's totally horizontal. I collaborate with four other people who each have their own studios, so everyone is on level footing.
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
"[http://lorimer.info/ample/](http://lorimer.info/ample/) & [http://lorimer.info/experiment/;](http://lorimer.info/experiment/;) I built this projector gun with the other people in my studio. Basically, it's a device that allows you to project anywhere for 2-3 hours, and also manipulate the projection in real time or have anyone else in the world do the same (through a cell phone). I'm interested in ""opening"" up this device, so that anybody else on the hike could use it for their projects."
###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
Visiting SMT twice. Doing one SMT session. Dealing with my crazy parents, does that count as communal living? Being heavily involved in Occupy Providence for about six months (not sleeping there every day, but being there all the time and often sleeping over). (etc.).
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
"I'm trying to create an ""autonomous mobile system"" for projecting language. So, I already have a backpack, the projector gun, a tent, etc. I'm working on raising the money for a solar panel, so I can have power off the grid. I've got a great camera for night-shooting. I want to practice doing these kinds of hikes where I can fire off art pieces up into the trees and record them. Or create ""surprises"" in the rural landscape, so that maybe if there are other hikers, they can come across a mysterious apparition in the trees, etc. I like the idea of making art in a kind of mysterious/inexplicable context."
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)
I think I'd want to lead a lecture on light. I'm taking an experimental optics class right now, and I think I could probably nerd out about light for like 10 hours straight.
###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)
I would just give everyone on the hike a projector gun so that we could be this roving light parade or light installation that is constantly making its way through the forest and is probably also visible at a distance. What would we be projecting? I'm not sure, photographs of the forest onto itself. Poems about nature... At another SMT session I asked everyone to write down their dreams and I constructed poems out of people's dreams. Maybe we'd just do this the whole hike long and project our dreams onto the forest.
###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
Do you want to fall in love at SMT? 
 
Yes.
###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summer
I'm also applying for a residency in Detroit, but I'm not sure exactly what's going to happen with this.
###How did you hear about SMT?

###What sorts of foods do you not eat? What foods are you allergic to?

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
I grew up in New York City. Spent time in the Midwest for School (undergraduate studies at Oberlin in Ohio, graduate studies at The Art Institute of Chicago. For the year and a half I have lived and work in Brooklyn. I am a video and performance artist. I work in time based mediums and am very interested in time as a medium-- slow time, collapsed time, repeating time. I also work as a teaching artist in New York. This practice is very important to me as well, spending time teaching art in New York City public schools feeds my artistic practice and vice versa. I like to teach, talk, dance, eat and make art.
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
In my creative practice I often use 'participants' to generate material that is then used in my video projects. I create structures in which 'participants' can contribute thoughts, words, perspectives etc. I consider these 'participants' collaborators in some way.  
 
Example of such a project can be seen here:  
[https://vimeo.com/25423335](https://vimeo.com/25423335) 
 
 
I also have worked on a number of more traditionally collaborative projects with fellow artists. Below are some examples:  
 
[http://gplusgcollective.com/statement](http://gplusgcollective.com/statement) 
[https://vimeo.com/57159845](https://vimeo.com/57159845) 
 
Over and over again I turn to my external world and the people in it (both friends and strangers) to aid me in my creative process. Between reading groups, traditional and less traditional modes of collaboration, I feel that the people around me are constantly influencing my practice, process and perception.
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
Below is a link to a video project entitled, Dedication to this View. It is a 45-minute video that pieces together original and found footage to create a long, meditative work addressing themes of distance, concealment, sexuality and the act of viewing. Though theme was clear when I began the project, the process of taking and then editing the footage organic and highly institutive. This way of making is very different from other projects of mine that use structure and constraints in their process. The majority of the material was shot with an iPhone, at times entering into the realm of the diaristic and banal, producing a video that acknowledges the tool of its production. The video builds through a process of compilation and in its careful attention to rhythm and pattern, and attempts to push the banality of living in the world until its strangeness is exposed. The informal performances and occurrences of day-to-day life that are chronicled in the video are abutted by altered footage from historical film and performance art. Dedication of this View acts as representation of, and meditation on, the intersection between these considerations. As the video weaves together a series of sources, the subjectivity of the artist/performer/editor emerges as the constant and is continually projected into the frame of both original and found footage. This video and the process I engaged to produce it felt to me to be a process of unthinking, of allowing my daily life to bleed into my artistic life and vice versa. I was interested in breaking down and challenging the way I was ‘knowing’ and approaching my artistic practice while in graduate school.

###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
My most recent communal living experience was last year. I spent a month at a residency in Italy. I shared a room with three other women and shared a kitchen and living space with 16 international residents. We made did communal grocery shops and made communal meals. We spent our days working together on a publication that was put out by Mousse Publishing. The residency was particular in that we were not only living communally but we were also collaborating together throughout the month.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
I am very interested in the idea of unthinking/unknowning. After my time in graduate school (I graduated Spring 2011) I have spent a lot of time attempting to 'unknow' some of what I was taught or exposed to during the two intense years. I felt in many ways that my practice during school became too ridged and didactic. I believe an artistic, intellectual, creative practice thrives when there is a balance between critical rigorous inquiry and open ended process based play or discovery. Recently I have been spending some time at an Ashram upstate and beginning a mediation practice. Beyond my interest in cultivating spiritual practice, I have been excited to learn what thinking without thinking might do for my creative practice. I feel the class and its theme would touch upon a lot of the questions I am most engaged with right now in terms of how I approach life and my practice of making. It would be very beneficial to have a group of thinkers/makers to be in conversation with around these topics, as much of my work/thinking around this theme has up to this point been solo.

In the recent years, my practice has grown more solitary while my research more collaborative. In a sense I am within the times if I think about shareware, and open-source. I think my R&D in groups, with artists coming from varied practice – UQAR with a group of 20 mature artists in the north of Quebec, MPA with 20 professional visual artists women in and around Montreal, PBR at Stanford (MOOC) with a chore group of 5 professionals, artists & engineers from 3 continents (where I met Michael Borowski, alumni STM student), and RAIQ the Quebec group of interdisciplinary artists. At this time in my evolution as an artist, I am exploring the process of creation through my body as my principal media. Sharing ideas and process with other practicing artists and agents of change is my way of communal thinking and creating. 
Prior to my solo exploration through alter ego Dalidada, I have and still remain with a pan-Canadian clown collective (Les Babines), and curated and plan to reactivate in time Artist as Shaman, a multidisciplinary performances and installations exhibit mixing old and new technologies – the proposition to artists is to pair with an artist of a different field and while creating their own piece, feeding off of each other's process and present at the same time. “Under the Nose” (clown) was presented in Winnipeg during the 2011 Fringe festival and “Artist as Shaman” at Eastern Bloc during the Art Matters Festival 2012.

The most collaborative think-work I have fostered which continues to influence on my practice is homônumos, where a mix of artists and non-artists of many cultures discoursed on a theme. homônumos means 'all humans share one family'. Our mascot is 'siren' which is the 'one human with an idea' ( see Twitter image above) The foundation of homônumos was built on fostering a common sense of belonging, building on our differences such as it existed in the 8th century Alhambra, the sharing of philosophies, arts and science. I have been researching since my return in Montreal how to bring back homônumos presented as a digital open shareware. 
My favourite articles are those I worked on with non artists because they led to a self discovery, repositioning of perspectives, and an opening to auto-determination for all parties. I asked a shop clerk I met at the Russian market to translate a bedtime story of her childhood into English. It turns out she spoke 4 languages with no common roots (Buryat, Russian, English, Mandarin)! I asked her to note when she had to think of a word in Russian or Mandarin. In this way, we mapped her language process. Another favourite article was written by Beijing local&in-the-closet queer tour-guide, reflecting on the dual street names of Guo da jie and Dongzhimenwai da jie albeit in a non historical discourse. And finally, blessed was our round table with Taoist priest in Dali Yunnan and German Protestant pastor in Beijing discoursing on infinity. 
Co-directed as a pair, the team selected articles on commission, by people we met in Beijing, in our travels, and through our social network on the subjective basis of simply wanting to hear what a person had to say on a specific thematic. We further asked the contributors to express themselves in the language they thought of the idea so as to preserve the essence of the original thought. The note from the editor and the round table were translated in French, English, and Mandarin. homônumos topped 8 languages in one issue within its first year of publication. Distributed at 1000 units, we sold the magazine in Beijing, Thailand, Hong Kong, it was distributed in literature departments in USA, art galleries in France, sino-science as archive in Belgium' national library, and grassroot cafes in London, We infiltrated DIAF international art festival and are featured in their catalogue without ever having been invited, we self-funded 2 years of existence on print and in-situ performances. While being expelled from Beijing in 2008 in the midst of the Olympic corruption, homônumos disintegrated. 
This blurb is well over 400 words but worth 1000 more. I continue to work life as art, and think life as a collective of binding differences.
###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
(2009-2014) years living in a loft with 4 other people, their partners, drop-ins and a variety of plants, shower/bath schedules, and food beliefs. I do much better get along with girls; I live with boys too. I prefer dirty work to sweeping shelves. I keep my mess in my room (not so messy at all). What I like best about communal living is sharing my yoga practice with roomies, morning kitchen parties, 5-7 decompressing with talks on love, commitment/non-commitment issues, health (body and mind), job-hunting, art projects. Peeking on a roomy rehearsing a performance or training handstand is a plus. I find it hard when roomies slak on their assigned chores.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
Practice-based research, outdoors, experiential and explorative knowledge transfer, artists in various fields, communal living, displacement, all ages. All elements which foster potential conflicts, open possibles and reveal impossibles – elements essential to the out-of-the-box creative process I feed on. I likely will come out of SMT better equipped to situate my practice within the field of performative work. 
I also met Daniele Bourque in Toronto, while part of a performance that was dedicated to her, and will again meet her during a 2-day individualized coaching with Sylvie Tourangeau (TouVA) on performative presence. Much of my work is dealing with the immaterial and embodiment of. Bourque and Korta are well equipped to understand and guide me.

###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)
I envision a project* that would grow into the community, in the divide between the geo-locations of SMT and my own home (Montreal). I would like to propose a project that is the extension of what I wish to come to SMT for – transferring stories of innate objects into living stories in my body. I call this proposal, 'Project 'embodying your daily ritual'-one action of domestic nature'. The first part of the project is to perform my research in a conference-type environment at SMT to current participants + coach a 'how-to' somatic research session. The second part is enlisting bodies + pre-stamp post card invitations and send to residential homes along the train line corridor between SMT and my home. The third part is taking the 'arms' with a cell group (trained at SMT) and infiltrate domestic space by 'embodying your daily ritual'-one action of domestic nature to homes who have RSVP to the post-card invite. The bonus part is possibly infiltrating cell group's own SMT-homebase commute route (extra-extra funding). *always archive for iterative PBR, diffusion, and monitoring evolution.

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
I am a multi-disciplinary artist with a strong interest in the boundaries of the body and the confrontation with mortality. I spent the previous year as an Arts Fellow at The Drisha Institute of Jewish Education studying Torah with a creative focus on death, destruction, and resurrection in the Talmud. I received my BA from the University of Chicago in 2012, where I studied the intersection of aesthetics and ethics through literature and the visual arts.  
 
My artistic practice stems from a fundamental fascination with the permeability of bodily borders. I investigate the ways in which we experience and process our physicality and materiality in the face of what lies beyond our bodies and our lived experience. I am heavily influenced by the texts and practices of various religious and spiritual doctrines, as well as literature and philosophy that addresses death, aesthetics, faith, emotion, and ethics. Profound attention to the written word, as well as texture, movement, and space, is the foundation for constructing multi-disciplinary art experiences that audience members can access through various layers of consciousness. My work is meant to bring viewers into confrontation with the limits of being in order to recognize the inherent beauty of what lies on either side, in order to transcend fear and liberate pain. I seek to temper the morbid and the grotesque with a reverence for details, to infuse the shadows with grace.
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
I am very attached to conversation as a tool for processing any stage of creation, from idea generating to logistics. This allows me to clarify concepts and refine details. Whether or not I am collaborating with another person in the traditional sense of sharing authorship, I rely on conversation and consider it a collaborative practice. 
 
Currently, I am collaborating on an experimental film adaptation of a Kafka short story with my brother, an NYC based filmmaker. We began by closely reading the text and building off of each other's interpretations until we aligned our vision of the text. We used these thoughts as a foundation for the screenplay, which we debated at length. Now, we are in the midst of story-boarding the screenplay; we discuss what is contained in each image and its significance, how this moment should affect the viewer, and how we can best frame the moment to achieve this.  
 
Last spring, I co-choreographed a performance piece based on the tahara, the Jewish ritual washing of the dead. The two of us usually focused our energies on different aspects of the work: I was more concerned with the conceptual framework, while my partner was more interested in specific movements and transitions. Much of the work consisted of us moving around in a room together, testing our ideas, and discovering what we both liked.  
 
I am eager, always, to experience new collaborative structures.
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)

Ani Hashem Rofecha: A Cabinet of Curiosity  
 
The Cabinet of Curiosity, also known as a Cabinet of Wonder, or a Wonder-room, was an encyclopedic collection of objects whose categorical boundaries were as yet undefined. A precursor to the museum, this European Renaissance form was likened to a ""theater of the world"" and conveyed a certain control of the world. The attempt to classify the unclassified, to possess the elusive, created the illusion that profound knowledge had been grasped. While these cabinets are impressive, their contents spark more questions than answers. Indeed, the Cabinet of Curiosity conveys an attempt to know, and the impossibility of doing so.  
 
Drawing from Chapter 11 of Tractate Sanhedrin of the Babylonian Talmud, I have created and curated a Curiosity Cabinet of objects and ideas. Through the micronarratives in Sanhedrin, we attempt to know God and (wo)man, and in turn, we are given only holy fragments, fragments of a disembodied God and disembodied (wo)man. This cabinet explores God as destroyer, healer and redeemer. The Cabinet of Curiosity doubles as a medicinal cabinet for a body that is entirely decontextualized, wherein bone and viscera encounter the destroying, resurrecting, redeeming, healing God before we do."
###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
Among the many communal living experiences I've had, the most colorful was the month I spent in Tsfat, in the very north of Israel, in an all women's seminary for the study of ultra-orthodox mystical Judaism. The expectations of this community were beyond anything I could've imagined: we were to keep our knees, elbows, and collar bones covered; we were to pray, as best as we could, three times a day; and we were discouraged from interacting with men, should the rare opportunity present itself. I was more aware of my collar bones than I had ever been in my life, developed an intense fondness for the utility of scarves, and sang out loud despite the rebuke of our male security guard. I learned deeply how far I could stretch myself for the sake of community and how far I was willing to go. Despite the everyday frustrations of my short visit to this world, I forged profound connections with my seminary mates, whether through contemplating the nature of God or laughing at ourselves before bed.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
The very idea that thinking is a creative act spurs my artistic practice. I am very drawn to a critical approach, and have struggled with the idea that critical analysis can be understood as, by nature, deconstructive. The act of analysis, however, is an attempt at constructing meaning, which is a profoundly creative act. I would like to continue to explore this tension, which informs the core of my artistic practice. The course on Unthinking/Unknowing would be a perfect place to do so. 
 
I am extremely interested in the limits of the body, and this fixation is coupled with the less urgent but ever powerful fascination with the limits of the mind. I am interested in exploring this through conceptually and experientially. In the work I create, I seek to draw attention to line between the known and the unknown, between this world and the next. Exploring this liminal space through thought and experience strikes me as particularly important, so that I might gain insight into how to bring audience attention to processing this liminal space when I create my own work. The course on Unthinking/Unknowing addresses my key interests through an innovative and multivalent approach, which appeals intensely to me. I work in a multi-disciplinary fashion in order to access the wisdom of articulated and unarticulated thought and emotion. This course would illuminate these access points and deepen my practice substantially.
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)

###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)
I would like to mount an interactive installation that investigates death, memory, and loss. The space would resemble a bedroom and be laden with objects and clues about who once inhabited the space. These three options would be valid: a. the room belonged to a deceased person; b. the room belongs to someone who may or may not be deceased, and who is speaking through the objects; c. the viewer is the deceased. The inclusion of relational objects would be an important aspect of the project, as well as the participation of one viewer at a time. The objects, as well as the space itself, would slip between the extremely mundane, the abject, and the surreal, thus sliding between an awareness of the body, at its most visceral, and the psyche, at its most detached. I would be keen on experimenting with how to blur the line between the felt and the seen; the sense of the living and the sense of the dead. This would ideally be a space of confrontation and healing.
###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
What will you write next?  
 
My next piece of writing shall be an elegy.  
Not because I have lost anything in particular,  
but because I often feel that I have, and will always,  
lose everything.  
 
When I write again, it shall be an elegy.  
Perhaps, to my body.  
One can never start planning too early. 
And there are so many ways to lose a body,  
its pieces and parts.  
 
We must always return to memory.  
To keep ourselves sane.  
To keep ourselves smart.  
To keep ourselves good. 
  
Or eliminate memory, and soar.

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Session A (BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE // RECONSTRUCTING WILDNESS), Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
"I'm a musician based in NYC. I release electronic music as Ink Jet. 
 
In terms of employment, currently I work both as a freelance composer (for commercials, film, etc.) and at a small design/branding agency as a producer (jack of all trades). I'm in the process of transitioning toward full time music/audio work. 
 
As an artist/musician, I'm interested in the creative possiblities offered by manipulating sampled audio. The music I produce with samples ranges from basic hip-hop beats (""ripping off"" for bars and slapping some drums on it) to more involved productions composed of many tiny samples from various sources. Sampling is often derided as simple stealing, but I think producers like J Dilla, Madlib, the Avalanches, et al. clearly create artistic value with the choices they make. I aim to make music that brings the relationship between sampler and samplee to the forefront. 
 
On a related note, I've also started writing about the effect that the interfaces of electronic music equipment have upon the music created with them. My current focus is on some of the classic samplers (MPC, SP-1200) used to make iconic hip-hop and house records. The UI of gear almost inevitably leads to specific musical choices, but I haven't seen these choices discussed outside of informal conversations with other electronic music producers. 
 
I'm also interested in interactive music projects I'm currently developing a project tentatively titled Crowd Raps. I set up a phone line that, when you call in, plays a hip-hop instrumental. The caller is encouraged to rap or sing along to the beat, and anything they do is recorded to a server. The plan is to edit down the best calls and release them as completed tracks online."
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
"My work is collaborative in a few different ways. 
 
Most directly, I sometimes work on music with other artists, writing and playing together, or collaborating in different media (e.g., dance + music). 
 
Currently I'm working on a project called Crowd Raps (described above) that's more of a combination of collaboration and curation. In it, I solicit singing and rapping from callers, then review their submissions and edit interesting together ones for release as the ""final product."" In this situation, the callers are reacting to music and creating something of their own, but they don't know how their own contribution will exist as part of the final work. 
 
I'd also argue that in performing live as an electronic dance musician, the relationship between performer and dancers - traditionally viewed as performer/audience - can in fact be collaborative. I've been in situations where the music I played was directly influenced by activity on the dance floor. 
 
All of that said, much of my work is produced entirely on my own. I'm interested in the School of Making Thing precisely because I want to open up my creative process to collaboration!"
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
"I've recently been releasing music under the name Ink Jet. Last summer, I put out my first record, Grandma Tapes. 
 
The music on Grandma Tapes was composed with a set of strict rules: 1) Every sound on the record was sampled from a box of cassette tapes my grandmother left for me when she died. 2) Each track was created from samples of a single work by a (generally Romantic classical) composer. 3) I used a single hardware sampler to create the record; I wanted to stay away from working in the visual environment a computer offers. 
 
These rules helped direct me through a creative process that examined the musical taste of a past generation while generating music that sounded vastly different. The experience of listening to the tapes was very emotional for me; I listened to them imagining how my grandmother had. It was also a way to deeply explore the technique of sampling; I learned to doing things like coax a dance-style kick drum out of a symphony. 
 
Currently, I'm working on a series of musical sketches as part of a weekly project I call Natural Athleticism. Every Wednesday in 2014, I'm releasing a new track online. Each one is based on a rough idea from a list I've drawn up: e.g., ""make music claps that slowly grow into applause, then return to rhythmic clapping"". Natural Athleticism is a way to keep myself working through specific ideas that interest me, rather than simply ""writing songs"". 
 
Both of these projects are linked above."
###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
I spent my first two years in New York living with a group of other musicians. This wasn't an organized communal living experience so much as simply living with roommates, but it had a great effect on the art I created. Specifically, my proximity to people with different taste got me involved in styles/genres that I had previously never even tried to understand. E.g., I used to think that most four-to-the-floor dance music was too rhythmically simple to pay attention to; now I make some myself. Long story short, my experience of living with others was one of opening up my mind to different forms of expression. 
 
Another thing that's important to me: communal food. I love to cook and eat with others, and hope that will be a part of the SMT experience.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
"""Between Nature and Culture"": to start with, I agree with the central conceit: wildness IS creatively enticing to me. Let me share a dream I had a couple years back: 
 
I was a small four-legged creature, no distinct species, a proto-mammal. I spent my time lurking in the undergrowth of a forest by a clearing. I would peer out from the shadows and look at a sunny puddle of a milky pink liquid. I felt afraid of an unknown force (a predator above?) but when I worked up the courage, I would dart out to quickly sip at it, then jet back to the shadows. Then, I felt a pressure welling up inside of me. I walked out into the light, raised my little head up to the sky, and roared with my full body and soul, howled at the sun. Then I woke up. 
 
I bring this up because the dream put me in touch with a sort wellspring of primal, weird energy within me that I had been ignoring or suppressing. And in the years since, I have failed to harness whatever powerful experience I had in that dream, though I've thought about it a lot. I realize that this might come across as absurd, but I hope that the Nature/Culture session might give me a helpful lens to address this topic of untapped wildness in myself. 
 
I'm also intrigued by the subject of Unthinking/Unknowing. I'm always looking for situations that bring about creative thought, from running to meditation to substances to a shower. My current method of making art treats creative thought like work, providing a steady framework in which to let the mind free. I hope that this session would open me to a broader set of exercises that might change the way I think."
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)
N/A
###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)
"Given unlimited funding, I would love to mount a massive sound installation on a chunk of woodland. I would set up sensors everywhere: microphones, thermometers, flex sensors to sense tree limbs flexing in the wind, infrared cameras, etc. The area would be rigged up like an embassy, but the technology would be hidden as much as possible. I'd use the feedback from these sensors to create a kind of amplified nature, a set of sounds that take direct audio from the microphones and process it based on other realtime data, expressing the conditions of the moment through sound in a way that a listener in that spot could intuitively understand. 
 
Alternatively: given all those sensors, the piece could satirize the surveillance state. The participant is escorted to a hut with a computer terminal. They watch a real time read out of what's happening on the land, stylized like a security system in a movie. The participant is directed to complete a few simple tasks on the terminal, e.g., clicking on boxes to ensure levels are in line. At a predetermined point, the system would ""malfunction"", and the real time sound described above would roar all around the participant."
###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
"What kind of artist would you like to encounter at SMT? 
 
Of course, I'm open to anyone I might encounter, and I want to be surrounded by a diverse group of people. But one type of artist I think is underrepresented in the ""serious art"" world: comedians. I'd love to have comedians working out new material alongside all the other artists and writers. In general I enjoy art that has a sense of humor, and I think having someone who specializes in humor around would enrich the experience for everyone."
###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summer
None for either of these periods.

falling hurt alot ! 
but it was also good 
because i learned how not to be spinning 
just kidding! 
i dont know how not to be spinning 
but it was still good to fall 
and i am committed to the goodness of this experience 
falling down onto the steaming summer lawn with popsicles 
falling into the sky dreaming unravelling wandering mysteries 
falling in love falls through me like a leaky pot in the rain 
i am the moss beneath the leaky pot in the rain
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
"i build experiential interactive installations that are about contagious human behavior, interconnectivity, influence and consciousness. 
i use various forms of sensory communication to create experiences of awakening.  
collaborations are a key element in my creation of experiences: working together with the audience and/or creating with other artists. 
the ""red room"", the ""yawning booth"", the ""universes""... all are about sensory immersion and participation."
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
"The ""Yawning Booth"" installation is an environmental and audio sensory experience. It is a booth shaped like an out house that people go to yawn in. Inside the booth soft sounds of me continuously yawning illustrate interconnectivity and mirror neurons in the brain as the audio yawn is ""caught"", or passed from one body to another. The yawn enters through the first person's ears in the booth, is absorbed into the body and then reflected back out through the yawning body into the eyes of a live camera, so that elsewhere that yawn will be passed to the video viewer through the eyes. An onlooker can then observe this person yawning in real time, and then receive and pass along more yawns through live observation and so on."
###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
"""Nothing like bumping butts in the kitchen"", as my friend eliza's mom from montana used to say. i love cooking and creating with friends. 
i once lived in a 2 bedroom house with 13 people in california.... ah good times.. 
helped start a farm in upstate new york, still visit often.. 
most of the living situations i have had have been communal, i prefer sharing most items: grains, veges, most tools... while maintaining personal autonomy in other areas : face cream, toothbrush... 
my favorite thing ever is family dinner ."
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)

wildness requires me to abandon preconceived ideas and exist in the present moment to the degree that i can reach and seek for the experience (as through the application process here), but not know too much about it.  
i hope to lose as much as i gain in this wildness... 
(my band is called wild life free way, naturally i feel a affinity for this course)

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
I’m applying in collaboration with Ari Marcantonio. I’m currently finishing up my MFA at the University of Iowa. I gave up a tenured job teaching art to high school students to return to school. While most people get their MFA so they can teach, I did the opposite. I love academia, and spent the three years prior to becoming a high school teacher getting an MA in Art Education, but am excited to be finished with it for a while. Due to the dearth of queer studies at the university I’m at, I’ve become a bit of an autodidact in the field, which relates to my work, where I address issues/ideas around the development of queer subjectivity. For many years I lived in the San Francisco Bay Area where, prior to teaching (and a bit less while living a professional lifestyle), I played in bands and had an amazing house in the Mission where I hosted tons of pop shows. Because of that, I’ve been able to travel extensively, which is something I love. I recently met and talked to Yvonne Ranier, who I really connected with when I told her I studied classical ballet for nine years, and was excited to talk with her about bringing my past as a performer into my current visual-art practice. Which is something I’ve been trying to do and thinking a lot about. I’m trying to commit entirely to my creative practice. While most of my colleagues are applying for jobs, I’m applying to residencies. This commitment is scary, because it means no income, transience and precarity. There is a part of me who just wants house-plants and a cat, but I feel like now is the time to throw caution to the wind and see what happens. I’m excited!
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
I guess one theme of my life, whether it’s been having shows at my house or teaching in the classroom, has been community building. This is important to me because I believe that we only truly begin to know ourselves through our encounter with others. While the majority of my creative practice has been a kind of traditional, studio based one, I’ve always imagined it to be based in communication and just one tool through which to experience that encounter. Lately though, I’ve been expanding what it means to create work that is in communication with the viewer and make work that actually requires the viewer to participate in order to be complete. I’m trying to collaborate with my viewer not just in the creation of meaning, but in an actual physical experience as well. So, a dance floor that asks you to step up and make a spectacle of yourself, for example, is a different experience than just looking at an object or performance as a viewer. I always thought of my teaching practice as collaborative, and I’ve been lucky through my teaching to have found an actual collaborative partner (you’ll learn a bit more about that in the next section). While here at the University of Iowa I have collaborated with another person in my department to build community through the organization of a queer print exchange portfolio that’s going to be shown at the Southern Graphics Council International Printmaking Conference. Part of the reason I wanted to participate in an MFA program was for the critical community and the opportunity for growth that can be experienced through collaborative thinking and dialogue. I’ve been lucky to have that community the past three years and I hope to continue to figure out ways to keep having it.
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
In 2012 I participated in an artist residency in Northern NM called PLAND (Practice Liberating Art through Necessary Dislocation). It consisted of living in a trailer for three weeks with my collaborator, who used to be my student, in the desert outside of Taos. Rather than write a description of it here, I would ask that you follow the link to the collaboratively written piece we wrote for the Notes on Looking website titled “Take A Sauna”. Thanks

###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
My most intense communal living experience would probably be that of a touring band. Several times in my life I have been on tour with more than nine people at once. Living in this way, making decisions, trying to find some personal solitude while packed in a van, sardined on the living room of some strangers house, or back stage, or even just being able to navigate the myriad issues that come up when nine plus egos are trying to find consensus on where to eat in some unknown city can be crazy making. I have found though, that I'm a good peace-maker. I've always been a good listener and very empathetic, but with little tolerance for BS and not really afraid to call it. That's served me well in these situations and I think that I’ve been an asset to my groups of friends in these instances, helping to alleviate tensions and opening avenues of communication.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
Standing on the precipice of life after graduate school is terrifying, not because I’m worried about work (finding it or making it for myself), or even because (like many of my colleagues) I don’t know what I want out of life. I DO know what I want out of life, and the terror comes from an understanding that the structure of our society privileges a certain type of person to achieve it. I know what it’s like to try and pursue a creative life outside of the academy, how the pressures of living make it more and more difficult to dedicate time, resources and physical and mental faculties to something that is often simply a labor of love, with little or no return. I’m interested in the session Unthinking/Unknowing because I want to challenge myself to do just that. I want an opportunity to think differently about my creative practice. How can I engage with it in different ways that don’t rely on what have become standard ways of making for me? Collaboration with Ari is one way that I have achieved that. In our own collaboration we ask how we can undo trusted modes of inquiry, use of critical texts and attachments to theory to become more articulate with ideas in an expanded realm of cultural production? This session and the description of the process seem to be exactly the kind of thing that will help us do that. All of this and engaging in a critical community and building relationships across disciplines and geographic location are why we would love to attend SMT. Timing is also important. I am dedicating this year to pursuing residencies before having to buckle down and get a job. July is when my new life begins.
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)

###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)
Ari and I recently had our astrological charts read in an attempt to better understand our fundamental differences and how they impede our communication. During our sessions with the astrologer a strongly coincidental similarity in our charts lead to the possibility that we had a relationship in a past life which ended tragically and that the current difficulties in our relationship might be the result of this past life trauma. If we had enough money to pay for it we would hire a hypnotist to lead us through past life regression therapy in an attempt to better envision how this past life narrative might take form. Our interest is in the metaphorical potential of this narrative to shed light on the actuality of our lived relationship and on the macro level parallels that our conflict might have in contemporary society. This closely relates to the theme of session B. Through this process we are working towards unthinking and unknowing our current modes of communication, stagnancy in our relationship, and to open up new and radical modes of relating to one another and the world. We see the potential to reimagine the possibilities of both our friendship and our creative collaboration.
###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
I often ask myself “why art?” In a world where commodity fetishism and rampant neoliberalism rule the art market I wonder why it feels so important to do the work of cultural production. In the end, I realize that it is because the inquiry that happens through the creative process is ultimately valuable. That the questions that arise out of that process, and the process of sharing those questions and the tenuous and myriad answers that are sometimes produced, allow for different ways of thinking and hopefully, through a carefully articulated aesthetic experience, eventually, actual radical change.

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
I am applying in collaboration with Jaime Knight. I am an artist, writer and chef; I recently graduated from university where I gained valuable insight into the process of socialization through a series of powerful participatory examples and am now trying to unpack the notions I have about how to be a productive and socially engaging artist, human and thinker. My recent artistic practice has taken form as a multi-disciplinary investigation of collaboration, competition and support, whether in the physical, psychological or interpersonal sense of the words. I work from two basic methodologies: the first being a critical model that investigates how things are and why and its counterpart, a productive model that proposes and enacts alternative structures. 
I am invested in the power of social organization and solidarity—the ability of human beings to build agency, empathize more effectively and effect change by speaking and acting with one another. I have been greatly influenced by the critical pedagogy of Paulo Freire and Bell Hooks and the social theory of Michel Foucault. From these writers I have gained valuable insight into the power of discussion as a tool for social liberation and fluidity, an understanding that informs the structure, content and form of my own practice and my appreciation of art in general. My recent work has been as diverse as building a functional sauna for a nascent artist residency in New Mexico, founding a pop-up dinner club that raises and distributes funding for underrepresented artists and facilitating discussions with my peers about the course of the art world and how we view our futures within it.
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
I work individually about as often as I work collaboratively and place great value in the potential of conflict and difference to challenge my preconceptions and enable me to empathize more readily. My collaborative work varies in structure (some examples are physical objects, performances and interviews/discussions) and I do not necessarily seek projects in which labor and investment are equally divided (although this has happened in rare cases) but am open to a wide variety of ways of working with and learning from the people around me. I believe in the potential of art to act as a socially mobilizing force and, whether I work individually or collaboratively, value the processes, discussions, arguments and reactions that the work can engender over any physical product. I view discussion, education and collaboration as tent poles of my practice more so than any medium-specific categories and I am excited by the prospect of a residency program that is based on dialogue, mutual growth and education.
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
While in residence at PLAND in 2012 my collaborator and I built a functional sauna to serve as a bathhouse for future residents. Rather than describe the work here I have attached a link to an essay co-written by my collaborator and I about the project:

###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
While in residence at PLAND (Practice Liberating Art through Necessary Disclocation) in Tres Piedras, NM I lived in an off the grid trailer with my collaborator for three weeks. In addition to dividing the physical and conceptual labor of our project we shared domestic chores such as cooking, cleaning and maintenance of the space. The work we did while in residence became as much about the physical structure we were producing as the process of living and working with each other in an isolated environment.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
The notion of unthinking/unknowing uncannily describes a feeling I have as a recent undergraduate. Art school was a blur of rapidly expanding potentials. My capacity to envision what art is or could be grew exponentially, at times reaching a critical mass that made any forward movement feel impossible. Now, that framework of critical mining is gone and I feel as though I have woken up at the bottom of the shaft. The important work ahead of me is to climb out of this space with the attention necessary to unpack what I found along the way. I have been given a powerful gift of multiple perspectives and the deconstructive tools necessary to balance them but what feels most necessary now is to forget everything I have been told, drop the baggage and find a way to make the practice I need for myself and my community real. Doing this is easier said than done and I know I cannot forget. But I can change my relationship to what I remember. For me, to envision thinking what I do not know how to think means making tangible what I know I need but cannot touch. I have touched many things like it but they all belong to others and do not quite fit me. I know I want to build something that can contain and support a collaborative yet challenging and discursive space, something that is responsive to the multiple desires of those involved and is flexible enough to meet them. I know I want this thing but as of yet it is only an abstract conglomeration of other structures, a reaction to what has come before. In order to think what I cannot think for myself I need to unknow what I have been told to want.
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)
I recently attended a participatory group dynamics conference the goal of which was to analyze the dynamics of those attending as they emerged. In this structure (known as the Tavistock method) participants, supervised by a largely inactively participating team of psychiatrists and psychoanalysts, are divided into groups and given no further instruction but to analyze their group dynamics in the “here and now”. I found this method enlightening and productive and would like to organize a “here and now” session at SMT. This would consist of sitting together for about one hour and simply saying what we feel as it arises.
###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)
Jaime and I recently had our astrological charts read in an attempt to better understand our fundamental differences and how they impede our communication. During our sessions with the astrologer a strongly coincidental similarity in our charts lead to the possibility that we had a relationship in a past life which ended tragically and that the current difficulties in our relationship might be the result of this past life trauma.

Through this process we are working towards unthinking and unknowing our current modes of communication, stagnancy in our relationship, and to open up new and radical modes of relating to one another and the world. We see the potential to reimagine the possibilities of both our friendship and our creative collaboration.
###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
Are there any art world structures, opportunities, institutions, etc that you do not know of existing but wish existed? 
 
My sister lives and practices at a Zen monastery and while visiting her there I was amazed at the community that had been built around maintaining such a specific yet individualized practice. The monastery is in a beautiful location and operates as a resort for the summer. During this time the students work full time (in addition to their practice) in exchange for room, board and zen instruction, in order to maintain and operate the resort. This three months of work supports the monastery as well as two others for the entire year. I want a school and residency program that is based on mutual support and collaborative life/work that engages capitalism in a way that the participants find comfortable in order to sustainably support the practices and lives of those involved.
###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summer

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Hike (A SUMMIT ON A SUMMIT)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
Hi SMT! My name is Rebecca and I’m a multidisciplinary artist and designer who lives in Brooklyn, New York. You may know me from last summer when I started a project about visual poetics using images from Google Search by Image, madegreen smoothies and read a lot of Kenneth Goldsmith in the hammock. My time at SMT last summer not only was a launchpad for an important project I’m still working on and developing, but helped me refine the kind of artist and thinker I want to be and continue becoming. 
 
My creative and intellectual practice has thus far spanned many different disciplines, scales, and modes of making (from sculpture to video to performance to design to image-based work) but my interest in technology and digital media, and in exploring the larger questions they raise, is one of the threads that runs throughout my recent work. Working on my project at SMT last summer solidified for me that this is a thread I want to continue to follow (both conceptually and technically) and helped inform my decision to apply to new media art graduate programs for Fall 2014. 
 
At SMT this upcoming summer, I hope to build on the experience I had last summer and push it even further; make better work, speak up more, develop even closer friendships and have deeper conversations, go on more adventures. I hope to continue to open my heart and mind to others, to learn how to wander, and continue to stretch my definition of what it means to be an artist and a maker.
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
My creative and intellectual work is collaborative both in literal ways and more oblique ones. That said, everything I do creatively is fundamentally and deeply reliant on my engagement with other people. In certain modes of making, I work actively with a collaborator or collective in a shared process of making and thinking (such as in my work on RECAPS with my collaborator Martabel Wasserman, or in my design practice); other times, my work is more independent and self-driven but nonetheless informed by a dialogue with friends, peers and other artists and thinkers. 
 
My most recent body of work, visually similar imgs, grew out of a project that I started last summer at SMT and the direction of the work (which is still constantly shifting and changing) was shaped largely by conversations and feedback and experiences that I had throughout the course of the session. I’ve been fortunate to have other opportunities to present the work among peers and groups of people, and each time the feedback I receive and the dialogue I enter into is incredibly useful and fruitful for me. 
 
Lastly, research is an integral part of my practice, and I see this as part of a process of collaboration in the sense that I am joining a dialogue or conversation that already exists.
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
[http://rebeccalieberman.com/visually-similar-imgs-books](http://rebeccalieberman.com/visually-similar-imgs-books) 
 
In David Buuck and Juliana Spahr’s An Army of Lovers, two poets come across a plot of land. Their initial discovery leads them through a progression of dream-like spaces, in which the plot of land is “also an enormous food court…not just a food court, but also an outdoor rehearsal space…not a rehearsal space, but a soundstage for gigantic live entertainments.” Through this protean space, in which theater is a warehouse is a bunker, the protagonists inhabit a universe in which things become other things, depending on how you look at them.  
 
In the kaleidoscopic odyssey of these characters, I see many of the questions that drive my work. My interest in creating a vocabulary of surrogates and substitutions is a thread that runs through both my major bodies of work to date: Whitetail Deer, A to Z and visually similar imgs. Through these projects, I’ve engaged with formal questions around the semantics of materials and the poetics of simile. I’ve explored strategies of remaking and restaging to estrange familiar systems and objects, and I’ve used formal grammars of equivalence, where things stand in for other things, to probe the contingency of meaning.  
 
visually similar imgs, which uses digital imagery culled from Google’s “Search by Image,” currently exists as a group of artist books, a website-based image work, and a series of looped video projections. Gesturing at the seams of familiar technology, I use material mined from search results in which Google fails to match an image based on visual DNA. In these proliferations of “visually similar” analogs, images become material: shapes and forms, pixel topographies, histograms of the everyday. They take on the ability to shapeshift into other things—a scene from a sci-fi apocalypse film parades as a fiery sunset and a fluorescent hotel room—and in them, I see poetic equivalences among the nonsense. visually similar imgs attempts to articulate a digital poetics of search, in which a grammar of simile and substitution is formed from the internet’s detritus. Mute and fragmentary images are liberated from conventional structures of meaning and reconstituted as semantic building blocks, like words in a poem. A dreamscape unfolds across the pages of a book, and the browser doubles as a hall of mirrors where unstable objects endlessly mutate and multiply.
###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
My most recent communal living experience was this past summer at SMT during Session B. Cohabitating with the seven or so other participants – cooking and eating meals together, sharing space in the barn, taking walks, making spontaneous morning smoothies and leaf collages – was a wonderful and fulfilling experience that I think allowed me to make better work, at the very least because I was so happy. Support structures of family and friends and roommates are incredibly important to me, and I understand the balance of giving and receiving that they demand. 
 
Prior to that, my most substantial cooperative living experience was during my last two years of college, when I was a member and resident of the Dudley Co-op, a 32-person cooperative house for Harvard undergrads in Cambridge, Mass. My time at the co-op was emotionally, intellectually and socially crucial to my growth as a person and as a friend and as a thinker. Within the broader culture of Harvard, this community was a safe haven for me, my ideas and interests, and my changing identity. It was a place where I made incredible life-long friendships, activated my own political beliefs and was exposed to new ideas and people that destabilized many of my most fundamental assumptions about the world. 
 
Being part of the co-op also gave me an important and lasting lesson in intentional living that has to this day impacted the way I treat my space and my community. Daily chores were part of the routine, as were attending weekly meetings to make community decisions and taking on longer “stewardships” to oversee larger things within the house.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
I hope to participate in the SMT Hike this summer because I’m interested in taking on an experience that feels new and profoundly challenging to me, both on a physical level and an intellectual level. I look forward to having a creative and intellectual experience that takes place quite literally “in the field” rather than in the confines of the studio, or the pages of a book (though I imagine we’ll engage in those kinds of activities as well).  
 
Within the past two years, much of my making practice has become somewhat immaterial and screen-based, in a way that makes me long for the days when I made very material work (large-scale sculptures, woodworking and performance) and engaged my body in that process. Last summer at SMT when I was thinking about this, I became interested in the idea of a walking practice. I hope to see how that practice of walking might become or intersect with my practice (if only for a few days), and I’m excited to feel what it’s like to be present intellectually as well as physically. I imagine being engaged in this different way might deeply impact the way I think and create. 
 
I also hope to participate in the hike because I’m interested in sharing an intellectually and socially intimate experience with a group. I look forward to the kinds of bonds that form and conversations that emerge when people are removed from their everyday structures and environments and placed into this kind of new configuration.
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)
I have many ideas for an immersive workshop or lecture to be given on the hike, but here are a couple. In the past few months, I’ve begun a meditation practice and so my first idea is to lead some kind of group meditation on the hike. It might be a sitting meditation (perhaps a Loving Kindness meditation, which is the kind I have been doing lately) or it could be a walking meditation, though I would have to look into these techniques a bit more. Either way, I think it could be a great group activity given the structure of the hike and the fact that we will be out in nature. 
 
My second idea is to lead sessions of structured making while on the hike, that are instruction-based and short in nature. Some ideas might be: 
- Make an object for walking 
- Make a work at the scale of the hike 
- Make a work at the scale of a stick 
- Make a work at the scale of a small pebble 
- Make a work using text
###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)

###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
Question: If you had to choose a question or organizing principle to determine the order in which people are to help themselves to dinner, what would it be? 
 
Answer: Mother’s first name, order determined by reverse alphabetical order
###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summer
No!
###How did you hear about SMT?

###What sorts of foods do you not eat? What foods are you allergic to?
I don't eat dairy

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
"I am a person who lives with intention.  
I am patient. 
I am not interested in being current. 
I am interested in being present. 
I listen to music obsessively and write about it actively.  
I like to listen emphatically and ask people sneaky questions in hopes of exciting or challenging them.  
Recently, I stumbled upon the thought that 'I love interstitial time and hate interstitial space'. At first, it was just a fun thing to say to myself. Now, I believe it to be intensely true; unavoidably so. Some of my writing happens this way. 
Confrontation is not my forte, but I am working at it when it counts. 
I wish that people of varying age groups would spend more time together. I value greatly the time and experiences that I share with those much younger and much older than myself. 
I have begun to exorcise myself of the concept of linear time. 
My friend Seth refers to me as a 'deep Pisces'. 
In a recent letter, my friend Katie described herself, regarding the consumer anxiety resultant from her purchasing an expensive leather bag, as ""not a materialist, but super fucking aesthetic"". This resonates with me. 
I have become interested in contemporary dance. Instinctually, it feels like a close sibling of the language arts. 
I am about 6'1 and 200 pounds, barrel-chested. Someone once told me that I move through the world like a small person. I took it as a great compliment. 
There is nothing I enjoy more than a colourful meal with interested people."
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
First and foremost, my practice is collaborative in the sense that the material it uses is language, and language is a massive and complex collaboration. I see it as a system of symbols agreed upon and shared by a group of people; language is delicate and full of imperfections. In this sense, my work is necessarily collaborative; it needs the support and understanding of others. 
 
In order for my work to be witnessed in any way, the reader's (or listener's) vocabulary must meet with mine and intermingle. We may share common ground in regards to symbols, we may not; we may think that we share a common ground when, in fact, we don't (and vice versa). Because of this, my work is as much about the transmission of ideas as it is about the discovery and inspiration of new ideas. It is always a conversation. 
 
Furthermore, my work is almost always borne out of the social experience. It is practically essential to my process that the subject-matter-to-be reveals itself to me through an experience 'out in the world', be it through participation or observation. I find inspiration in the way meaning moves in and out of language; the way conversations that happen subtly in loud rooms, the way words can bear great meaning without intention, the way banal descriptions of things can be taken as psychic metaphors.  
 
My writing is most often an attempt at encapsulating a social event; one that happens in a quiet flash, or one that reveals itself very slowly and in many places. 
 
My writing is at once an accounting of and response to the curiosities of living as a social creature.
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
[https://soundcloud.com/alvin_row-1/a-reading-of-conditional](https://soundcloud.com/alvin_row-1/a-reading-of-conditional) 
 
This is a piece entitled 'Conditional Performance' and it marks two important firsts for me as a writer: 
 
It is the first piece that I wrote that necessitates an oral presentation. 
 
It is the first time I've collaborated with anyone (editor's aside) on the composition of a piece of writing. 
 
Because the creative process associated with it was, for me, new and experimental, I see it as an exciting yet somewhat flawed piece. I included it in this section not because I think it's my strongest work, but because it represents my willingness to explore as an artist and it showcases my budding interest in welcoming people into my process. 
 
I began writing it, knowing immediately that it was an oral piece, but with no specific end in mind. When I was invited to read as part of the OBEY Convention (an outsider music and art festival in Halifax), I knew that this piece needed to be a part of my performance. After working the piece into a near-to-final draft, I invited my friends Cat and Jeremy (a politician and musician, respectively) to workshop it with me. 
 
Immediately, the two found themselves comfortably at opposite ends of the expressive spectrum: with Jeremy overly drab and Cat overly dynamic. As we worked through the readings, I invited the two to help develop their voices in the text, to sharpen the piece, adding and removing phrases and inflections as we three saw fit. 
 
As I eluded to above, I don't think it's an entirely successful piece, but I feel it offers multiple points of entry and a fair scope of my tendencies (good and bad). I am proud of it, unabashedly. I see the entire process behind it as a potential platform for work that I'd like to undertake at SMT.

In November of last year, I spent five days on an 'inquiry'. It consisted of a walk from Lunenberg to Halifax (roughly 109km) along a trail converted from an old railway track. I undertook this expedition alongside a visual artist, an architect, a basket-maker and a thespian. 
 
The intentions behind the trip were varied and mostly implicit. Each of us had spent time living in both locations so (to my mind) it was an exercise in understanding the mental and physical distance between the two places; a journey which we'd all made many times in ride shares or hitchhiking in the years preceding the walk.  
 
It also served as a time to reflect collectively on artistic ideals. We found walking such a distance together helped facilitate a free exchange of ideas, histories and concerns as well as meditative silences. With a full five days of uninterrupted company and commitment, conversation took on deeper proportions. 
 
The days were spent pacing towards the city. Each night we camped alongside the trail, sharing duties surrounding fire and food preparations. We slept five to a tent for warmth. The mornings consisted of stretching exercises, some readings from journals and discussions of trajectory.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
I feel that the themes and structure outlined in the Unthinking/Unknowing session are in perfect harmony with my current artistic fascinations.  
 
My most recent work has been focused on the instances in which language fails us. I understand these instances to bear a kind of freedom. Rather than being problematic, I see the 'shortcomings' of language as opportunities to engage with symbolic or associative meaning, to work through ideas that would otherwise be tangled in reasoning or issues of clarity. I am interested in playing with the way the mind accounts for incomprehensible language. I have been trying to write without concern from comprehensibility.  
 
Beyond that, I believe the social nature of the session will allow/insist that I explore more outside of the usual boundaries of pragmatic and poetic language. Early on in my development as a writer, I saw poetry as a mode apart from social instances; though often borne of social instances, I saw writing as a chance to speak outside of them, to speak free of the social restrictions of audience, time and space.  
 
Now, as I become more confident and immersed in poetic language, and develop relationships that allow for more open-ended, exploratory exchanges, I see that it is possible (and deeply rewarding) to bring that type of language into the social context (rather than the other way around). The more I experience it, the more I find myself yearning for social exchange, for intellectual exploration, that allows me to use language unfettered by pragmatism or social mores and to have that kind of language returned in kind. I see this kind of exposure as entirely formative to my identity as a writer, and I suspect that I'll experience it in spades during this session.
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)

###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)
An even-numbered group makes a daylight trip to a lake (ideally on foot or bike).  
 
Upon arrival, the group is divided into pairs and designated either Onshore or Unsure. 
 
Pairs then stake an area of the shoreline within sight but not earshot of the others. 
 
The Unsure is then prompted to share with the Onshore an inquiry, fascination or psychic hurdle surrounding his/her practice. 
 
The Unsure then swims a length of the lake (with option to break on the opposing shore). 
 
The Onshore develops a response to spur the Unsure deeper into his/her inquiry and re-opens the dialogue upon the pair's reunion. 
 
The Unsure repeats his/her swim with a new question in mind. 
 
This cycle repeats until both partners agree they've reached a mental plateau, wall or divergence. 
 
Once each group is done, all partners and roles are switched. 
 
After this second round, and a period of contemplation/rest/discussion, individuals are tasked with developing a brief affirmation based on their experience in the exercise (with the suggested exclusion of the terms 'I' and 'you'). 
 
Once prepared, the group is divided equally amongst the two shorelines, and asked to pronounce their statements one after the other, across the water.

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Hike (A SUMMIT ON A SUMMIT), Session A (BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE // RECONSTRUCTING WILDNESS)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
My name is Kelly Corinda Kraemer. I’m from Long Island, but I have lived in New Jersey for the past six years. I love literature, poetry especially. I like experiments with words and meaning. I look for art that feels as if it is revealed to me internally rather than added to me externally. I try to write poems and plays that make people feel like they are part of a common human experience (an experience that is more based in the idea of humanity than society). I try to be involved in whatever local scene I can and to learn from the artists in that scene. I have lived in suburbs and cities for all of my life and I would like a different experience than that. I think writing a bio is difficult. I am both quiet and friendly. My writing has lately revolved around salt, skin, golden, and ghosts. I have been dreaming of dirty water for a year, but now it is becoming clean. Some things I like are: dresses, card games, hot sauce, succulents, Sheila Heti, dogs of all kinds, mushrooms, sweet basil, myths and legends, foxes, hauntings, idiomatic language, mistranslations, Austin TX, Heather Christle, blood vessels, Richard Brautigan, Roberto Bolano, Yayoi Kusama, tacos, my family, bays and sounds, shells and fish, how one road can take you to any other road, windows, the radio, and infinity.
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
My creative practice is collaborative because my favorite way to write is through creative games, as well as because I often try to see how poetry can work with other art forms such as theater, music, and photography. Trying to create a kind of art that is not your specialty or that is outside of your realm of experience usually helps you to see your own art in a new and unexpected way. Playing inspiration and communication games with other artists and writers is a good way to shock yourself out of writing ruts (or any kind of artistic rut). I have found that artists of all disciplines work with a certain level of perfectionism and focus, and explaining your vision to someone else- how it is working, or not working, or how you have been changing it as the work progresses- helps you to clarify your own vision. I like to write based on clouds of ideas and I would like to do collaborative sessions that explore similar ideas in different mediums- even if the ideas are very broad, such as using an animal or a color or a local legend as a starting point, and then seeing where each person goes from there.
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
I think the chapbook that I have been working on is the work that best represents me as an artist that is fit for your program. The chapbook is called vertebrates, and is a collaboration with my sister- my poems and her photography. I wrote most of these poems with the feeling that one thing could be many things, or at least with the feeling that one thing could be something else. I am open to experiments with voice and form, and am extremely curious and willing to learn about almost anything. I think the most important part of writing this was how much I learned while doing it. It clearly doesn’t read as an academic or scholarly work, but to write these poems I first wrote pages and pages of notes on the meanings of different plants and flowers, Pagan and Roman symbols and history, human biology, different forms of reproduction, New Year’s traditions, and ideas about death, among other topics. I also took notes on various readings in nonfiction, fiction, poetry, and drama, and from studies of visual art. I am very curious and excited and interested in learning, and I hope this comes across in my work. I would love to be able to take this to the School of Making Thinking and have a whole month to work and learn in a new and creative environment.

###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
I have been living with roommates for the last six years, so I am very used to communal living situations. I currently live with eight other people in a house in New Brunswick, NJ. I have lived in two houses where most of the other people who lived there were also artists or musicians: my current house (Jones), and my house from 2011-2012 (Fire Island). I also briefly moved back to Long Island while I was interning in the city, and very soon after that my house was destroyed in Hurricane Sandy, so I spent six months saving money, replacing possessions, and learning how to be a very polite guest. I know that communal living requires always doing the dishes, even if not all of them are yours.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
I am applying for the Between Nature and Culture: Reconstructing Wildness session. I think that this session will help me develop as a thinker and as an artist because it is a topic that I am extremely interested in and would like to explore more. I am a tame person who feels connected to wild things. I am very interested in animals, humans, bodies, and nature, and how they all interact (especially in ways that feel true to the feeling of being alive). I would like to gain a greater background and framework to write about wildness from. Also, I would love to have the sensory experience of being in the Catskills for a month, and to be able to leave having developed new associations and a new vocabulary for describing nature and wildness in my poetry.
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)
The workshop/immersive lecture I want to lead would be based around texture, meditation, and poetics. I would want everyone to collect objects with different textures- stones, grasses, flowers, anything- and then to meditate while feeling those textures. During this meditation, I would like to discuss the different textures and structure/lack of structure present when creating works of art, how much of an influence environment has on creation, and how much control an artist has over the direction their work goes in after it has begun. Possible texts that I would use for this are “Invisible Architecture” by Barbara Guest, “Some Notes on Organic Form” by Denise Levertov, “The Poem as a Field of Action” by William Carlos Williams, the preface to Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman, and Madness, Rack, and Honey by Mary Ruefle.
###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)
The workshop I would lead would be a foraging expedition led by someone who knows the Catskills very well. The Catskills are good for foraging- specifically for ramps, chanterelles, chestnuts, beechnuts, blueberries, strawberries, amaranth, violets, mustard greens, chicory, and dandelions. The communal foraging and eating would be followed by time for personal creation or reflection.  
 
Foraging is a practice that is in the domain of the very “civilized,” high-end culinary culture of New York, as well as the wilder history of the area. How can foraging be so completely civilized and wild at the same time? The same question applies to art. Art is a way to express both wild and civil feeling, and indeed expresses some of the most “wild” and most “civilized” ideas of our time and throughout history. Foraging for nutrients, medicines, and decorations also provides a jumping off point for thinking about how creations develop- how you combine what you learn from society and what you gather from the outside world with your own personal tastes to create something unique. A workshop on foraging and its associated rituals would work very well as a way to investigate the questions that the seminar focuses on.
###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
Question: Kelly, how badly do you want to go on the hike and take the Between Nature and Culture: Reconstructing Wildness class?  
 
Answer: Very badly!
###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summer
None- I have off from work for the whole month of June.
###How did you hear about SMT?
The Internet
###What sorts of foods do you not eat? What foods are you allergic to?
Wheat- but I will happily bring my own bread/pasta

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Session A (BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE // RECONSTRUCTING WILDNESS)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
"I am an artist and educator living in Hartford, Connecticut. I feed myself in two ways: First, I am a fellow in the Studio Arts Department at Trinity College. I advise seniors on their thesis projects, am a teaching assistant in Steffani Jemison’s Video Studio course, and install shows on campus. Second, I work in the Hartford Public School district, where I collaborate with high schoolers on murals after school and tutor recent immigrants in classes that include Engineering, Graphic Arts, Biology, History, and Civics. 
 
In my studio I have been working between wet-paint, light, sound, and video to make ephemeral paintings. This performative process is documented in video and sometimes leaves behind still artifacts.The interactions in my work are alchemical, turning awkward mass into luminous gold. Occasionally I inhabit a character made from the materials in my studio, the focus of the lens, and the painterly metaphors of rap lyrics. She is an obscured ""video vixen,"" caught in the act of building the set surrounding her. Sometimes she seems pressed under glass. Sometimes her costume and figure disintegrate into pattern and light. Her studio is one stage upon which she can melt her own violent or tender experience of content and rhythm. She scratches this itch so hard that she peels back the synthetic skin of the image – only to find another layer of vinyl or Formica beneath it. In a moment of weakness she eats the ice cream she intended to paint with. A jug of acrylic paint slips from her hands and spills. She reaches for it, in a power grab. 
 
I am still trying to elucidate the nature of this power. Sometimes it seems contained within the space of the screen, and sometimes it extends into the substance of inarticulate social interaction."
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
I am applying to SMT as one half of a collaborative duo with Samer Sabri. We began working together as undergraduates at Yale University, and together we have explored a broad range of ideas by creating novel questions, objects, and contexts. In the past, each of us has claimed “authorship” over works we have created collaboratively. We are ready to claim dual authorship, and to attempt to make unauthored works. 
 
Samer has been a character in my videos and has helped me figure out how to situate the works in space during installation. My videos are highly visceral, and their placement in relationship to the human figure is not incidental. I’ve helped him think through computer games and produced the layout and the graphics for some of them. We maintain an ongoing dialogue which catalyzes every stage of our individual processes. We've learned to present ideas to each other at earlier and earlier stages of our creative process and have gotten used to thinking of the other person as the one who helps narrow things from a vast universe of possibilities, rather than the one who simply shifts the course of a work that had already embarked upon a particular path. 
 
All of my work depends upon augmentation by others. When my collaborators come before the camera they are self conscious. I often set up a narrow space and set of gestures within which others may act. My lens captures the blank stare that originates from a moment caught off guard. Human frailty in a “glamorous” moment is what lends the work its humor and its tragedy. My practice is about timing. Sometimes it is rhythmic timing. Sometimes comic timing. My own beat falls into and out of alignment with that of those surrounding me.
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
The Work: [http://ilanahb.com/UNTITLED-INSTALLATION-2012/solo](http://ilanahb.com/UNTITLED-INSTALLATION-2012/solo) 
Password: SMT2014 
 
I worked with Zimbabwean artist Rebecca Aston to make an interactive light installation at the Yale School of Art. Programming was unexplored terrain for me before embarking upon process that led to the work. It began when our personal ways of forming light in space collided. She was saw the code first: its ability to track and to mimic. I had been focusing on the ways light framed and tracked a body moving through space. 
 
We responded to the ways individuals navigated space in the School of Art. Where was movement predictably directional? On the stairs. On which staircases were people in a rush and on which did they meander? We were privy to the spoken and unspoken collaboration of the students moving through the building. We projected light and saw what happened. 
 
We tried to capture the hypothetical sensation of existing as silhouette in Hype William’s dizzying video for the crunk hit “Snap Your Fingers.” The result was a projection which tracked the shadows of people as the moved down the stairs with a rainbow of flashing colors that disappeared as quickly as they arose. The work blinded visitors as the moved up the stairs. All the while, the screeching, yet addictive beat looped endlessly in instrumental. 
 
This project came to mind when I came upon the passage on “Collaboration/Individuation” on the SMT website. While working with Rebecca (and learning from those who encountered our work by happenstance), my own personal voice was articulated with new-found clarity. Collaboration simultaneously defined and expanded the boundaries of my practice. I believe this occurred because of a willingness to change directions in response to feedback rather than get stuck upon prior work and expectations. Our joint efforts were additive, rather than oppositional.
###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
When I was 17, I spent 6 weeks living in the Telluride House at Cornell University. The program was free. I lived with 29 students, reading theory, cleaning house, and finding our own voices. The course I took, “Caribbean Dialogues[.com]” was taught by two Jamaican art-historians named Petrine and Petrina. A key part of the program took place outside of the classroom, in the echoing victorian house we inhabited. 
 
As high school students, we were responsible for deciding collectively how we wanted to interact with the academics we were given access to. We cooked our meals and had a say in how the program budget would be allotted. Some early proposals included spending all funds to fill a room floor to ceiling with ping-pong balls. All choices were determined during evening meetings which sometimes stretched 8-12 hours. We would vote, debate, and vote again in an attempt to reach a kind of consensus. We almost never slept, drifting in a fog full of new ideas. This experience cemented a belief in me that in small communities where mutual respect is a given, massive mistakes and grand triumphs are possible in small amounts of time.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
One question posed by the course description excites me in particular: can we embody wildness? In many ways, it seems as though we create the wild. It is formed on every edge by the boundaries of what we deem ordered. And so, if it is we who make wildness, can we make ourselves if we choose to embody the wild? 
 
My practice will benefit in several ways from SMT. The work Samer and I have embarked upon together can grow in an environment which does not place a premium on creation’s adherence to a specific discipline. The process-oriented nature of the session aligns with the way we work. Everything begins with conversations about a larger theme. Sometimes there are tangible remnants of these conversations. Sometimes all that is left is an immaterial lens through which new ideas can be viewed. 
 
My practice will benefit from a process which seeks to let go of “self-constructs.” Many of my videos chart a kind of hyper accumulation of self-construction. I attempt to capture in the moving image the visual and emotional congestion which occurs when one is acutely aware of being gazed upon: so much so that the screen they stare out from becomes an endless mirror to posture in front of. I want to attempt to break this mirror, pick up the shards, and see what is reflected there. Perhaps in this gesture my work might find a new way to approach wildness. 
 
Samer and I have written a purposefully porous proposal. The work we will do at SMT will be greatly shaped by the way others move through it. Where my work has previously been about pushing up against the hard membrane of the fourth wall, I would like to see what happens when it is pierced completely.

###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)
We are interested in the historiography of addiction and its relationship to notions of wildness. Is the addict one who has fully tapped into her inner wildness, or one who is completely submerged beneath systems of organization? 
 
The perceived pervasiveness of addiction is seated in societal anxiety. People choose to cling to the trope of an autonomous self making decisions independently. Faced with the utter failure of this model, they decide that the only kind of person that exists outside of it is the addict, the one of with no control. They thus end up turning every possible tendency and desire into a potential or actual addiction. 
 
We want to create a series of “addictive games” which will unfold amongst the community at SMT. Later, we will write “code from conversation”; computer games whose structure responds directly to the play as it unfolds. 
 
The games will be inflected by the broken rhetoric of 12-step programs, and influenced by Halberstram’s notion of fruitful failure. 12-step programs frame addiction as an accepted and unilateral state of being. We will build a program that seeks to cure the anxieties framing addiction, rather than the addict herself.
###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
Samer’s question for me: How can repulsion and attraction be polar opposites yet coexist? 
 
A shivering, goosebumped fear spreads through me when I encounter certain patterns. It’s the allure of things that seem organic yet eerily ordered: shapes that remind me of cells reproducing uncontrollably. When I see a scary pattern, my mind returns to it for hours. I have to relive the experience, often sharing an image with people I know share this disposition. Google “Trypophobia.” Many people think trypophobia was willed into existence by internet hypochondria. For me, the fear is real, and so is the allure.

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Session A (BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE // RECONSTRUCTING WILDNESS)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
I was raised in Lebanon, and I recently graduated from Yale University where I double majored in Computer Science and Ethics, Politics & Economics. I am currently a 4th and 5th grade math teacher in a Lebanese public school. 
 
My technical background is in mathematics, theoretical computer science, and systems programming. I am currently branching out to web programming and writing games for my students, using the “game mode” they get into to teach them math. 
 
I have been devoting a lot of energy to improving life and learning in my classroom. I’m always trying to see what my students see and steer them to what they need to see with the least amount of pain necessary. That means creating silly games, computer games, stories, or activities for new ideas to make sense. 
 
Each day I obsessively break ideas, events, or thoughts down into their most basic components. This habit ties into my background in philosophy. I work in a circular way; meaning that I focus on patterns that are repeated across very different domains. These patterns often even end up appearing in the very structure of my thoughts about them, thus creating a motif akin to a fractal. 
 
I write my philosophical ideas on a blog called “The Analyst of Random Things” (tartisme.blogspot.com), and I also write a blog on Lebanese and regional politics (in which I am very engaged) called “A country of strangers” (acountryofstrangers.blogspot.com). 
 
I am starting as a Business Analyst for McKinsey and Company in Silicon Valley next fall; I think that will allow me to continue improving as a communicator and a problem-solver. I am particularly excited about learning to conceptualize solutions to “systemic” problems because they are intellectually fascinating and they plague my region of the world.
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
I am applying to SMT as one half of a collaborative duo with Ilana Harris-Babou. We began working together as undergraduates at Yale University, and together we have explored a broad range of ideas by creating novel questions, objects, and contexts. In the past, each of us has claimed “authorship” over works we have created collaboratively. We are ready to claim dual authorship, and to attempt to make unauthored works. 
 
I have been a character in Ilana’s videos and I have helped her figure out how to situate the works in space during installation. Her videos are highly visceral, and their placement in relationship to the human figure is not incidental. Ilana has helped me think through computer games and produced the layout and the graphics for some of them. We maintain an ongoing dialogue which catalyzes every stage of our individual processes. We've learned to present ideas to each other at earlier and earlier stages of our creative process and have gotten used to thinking of the other person as the one who helps narrow things from a vast universe of possibilities, rather than the one who simply shifts the course of a work that had already embarked upon a particular path. 
 
My philosophical practice has increasingly been centered around making sense of the work concepts-in-the-world are doing and how their almost illogical, absurd underlying structure functions. The world of quotidian thought functions much more within that shifting, polymorphous universe than within one of cleanly ordered, axiomatic definitions. I want to keep digging and try to understand it better. This process is impossible without conversations with people about how things become important, and it is in these conversations that I am closest to the structures I am constantly trying to unearth.
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
I was taken by the statement “Learning is an openness of one’s identity to other’s practices and projects” on your website. 
 
For my senior thesis in Ethics, Politics, and Economics, I wrote about responsibility for structural injustice ([http://bit.ly/MCxGAL](http://bit.ly/MCxGAL)). In short, structural injustice occurs when social relations (unfairly) advantage one group over the other overwhelmingly in many dimensions. Structural injustice is, in the vast majority of cases, outside of the control of a single individual or a narrow group. Ending a structural injustice usually requires some form of collective action. 
 
In my thesis, I try to provide a good conception of individual responsibility for structural injustice; my solution is rooted in virtue ethics. I think this work represents me well because it emphasizes that the questions I focus on are questions that I mull over in my daily life and that I believe everyone ought to think about. 
 
I also use several different ways of progressing through my ideas: Chapter 1, where I explain why a virtue ethical approach is ideal to solve the problem, is much closer to analytical philosophy, with definitions and arguments that are clearly stated and structured. Chapter 2, where I argue for the particular “virtues” I have selected - such as “putting background conditions into question” - I use what I call a dialectical approach. I also include frameworks and arguments from other domains, such as game theory and mathematics (pp. 60, 61, 62) or English literature (pp. 66, 67, 78). 
 
I really enjoy making connections between and borrowing methods from very different disciplines and sources to think about a question that’s too “human” and multifaceted to be confined to one discipline or approach. Through my way of working, I can contribute to – and gain a lot from – being at SMT.
###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
Last summer, I went on a backpacking trip to South-East Asia and Eastern Europe with my roommates from college. We’d lived together for the past 3 years, but this trip was a radically different experience. We were nomadic: together from the moment we woke up to the moment we went to sleep for 6 weeks. We had never been to most of the countries we visited, and had very little time in each place. We had to make decisions all the time: where to sleep, what to see, what to eat, how to respond to crises, how to get to the next place. 
 
I think that we knew each other well enough that we knew when to delegate concerns to the right person and trust that person. For more difficult sticking points, my place in the decision-making process was to step out and refine – almost formalize – positions and objections to help the debate stay focused. We strove to find the most satisfying answer rather than the most satisfied victor. We learned to pick our battles and avoid nitpicking when not important or urgent. This trip made us all more patient and better at decentering ourselves.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
I think SMT is the best place for me to get better at thinking across fields and methods. Working with Ilana has allowed me to realize that I tend to enjoy instrumentalizing mental content. I am often trying to fit ideas into a framework that includes a thesis, arguments, and counterarguments. 
 
I would like to get to a place where I’m exploring with a wider scope of ideas without being constantly on the lookout for “the point” or “the right answer.” This is where the concept of the wild comes in. This concept poses a complex question: the “wild” is very often used to designate a territory that is foreign but also meant to be subdued; is there a way to “open” ourselves up to what we designate as wild without trying to “conquer” it? 
 
Even if that means letting go of the concept of the wild, is there a way to access this territory while respecting its integrity? It seems to me that if there is one, it has to come with a complete change in our mode of consciousness; our mode of appreciating the world.
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)

###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)
We are interested in the historiography of addiction and its relationship to notions of wildness. Is the addict one who has fully tapped into her inner wildness, or one who is completely submerged beneath systems of organization? 
 
The perceived pervasiveness of addiction is seated in societal anxiety. People choose to cling to the trope of an autonomous self making decisions independently. Faced with the utter failure of this model, they decide that the only kind of person that exists outside of it is the addict, the one of with no control. They thus end up turning every possible tendency and desire into a potential or actual addiction. 
 
We want to create a series of “addictive games” which will unfold amongst the community at SMT. Later, we will write “code from conversation”; computer games whose structure responds directly to the play as it unfolds. 
 
The games will be inflected by the broken rhetoric of 12-step programs, and influenced by Halberstram’s notion of fruitful failure. 12-step programs frame addiction as an accepted and unilateral state of being. We will build a program that seeks to cure the anxieties framing addiction, rather than the addict herself.
###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
Ilana’s question for me: Please provide an in-depth description of the sensations you felt during a time you were lost in the act of making. 
 
Recently, I got stuck on the 6th problem of this online programming contest: [https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/feb14.](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/feb14.) For 4 days, I spent all of my free time working on it. Deep in a black hole, I wasn’t weighing my choices. I pursued an almost visceral urge to keep trying, testing, and retrying. I became nothing more than this cycle of problem-solving. Only as I drifted into sleep did my sense of self reappear.

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Session A (BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE // RECONSTRUCTING WILDNESS), Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
"I'm a thirteenth generation American. My ancestors came over in Winthrops Fleet, just ten years after the Mayflower. They eventually settled in Northern Vermont, where the winters are long and cold, and they coped with the isolation by telling each other stories. Tall tales, true tales, absurdist yarns (complete with talking raccoons), and uniquely American war stories (Paul Revere is an ancestor) were my inheritance. Yet, I was uniquely drawn to visual storytelling in a way that was unheard of in my family. I studied Art History in undergrad, and went on to work in art galleries in London, New York and Los Angeles. While in LA, I started taking classes from Judith Weston author of ""Directing Actors"" and directed some plays for her theater. I was completely hooked. I applied to NYU Grad Film, got in, and I recently graduated. In the last two years I have been scrambling to make money (those student loan collectors are relentless!), and to start a Directing career."
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
Filmmaking is, by its nature, collaborative - and thats the best part of it. There is an electricity, when one crew members idea spark’s anothers and then anothers, and soon you are creating something together that is far more resonant than any of you might have created on your own. That kind of interconnected creation is what drew me to filmmaking in the first place.
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
I’d like to show you my short film Crazy Glue. [https://vimeo.com/22425398](https://vimeo.com/22425398) 
 
Crazy Glue is based on a short story. Prior to it I wrote all my own films... but I got myself into a little trouble when I wrote a film about my family. Though the film came out well (audiences responded well - I will never forget watching the waves of laugher as the erupted in the theater - it was a profound kinetic and cathartic experience for me) my father was displeased. Since then I have had trouble opening up and channelling such truths. I am not sure what makes me fit for your program, but I do know why I need a program like yours. I want to open up again, and brave channeling the truth of my own experience. Your residency feels like a place to take risks.
###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
Every living experience I have ever had has been communal. I have always had roommates - at one point I even lived in a factory loft with 10 photographers! I like to laugh and I value the unintended interactions that are a part of everyday when you live with many people. I like that a casual conversation around the toaster can spark a great idea. When you live alone you have to bring all the magic yourself. Its possible, but not nearly as fun.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
I am applying for Between Nature and Culture // Reconstructing Wildness and Unthinking/Unknowing because I am intrigued by both of them and well convinced that they could both do my imagination some good. 
 
At this point in my Directing career my job is to write a screenplay that is a pure expression of my voice. Squeezed in in the hours around my paper pushing day job, I fear my writing has become stilted, stale, a room in desperate need of an open window. It lacks surprise. It lacks wildness. Its too full of knowing and lacks the essential unknowing.  
 
A residency with other artists and thinkers would help me let the magic back into my tired brain, I believe. In my work I strive to delight an audience. I don't think that is a frivolous pursuit. Making sense and un-sense, if you will, of the world is the artist job. We must reframe human experience in a way that enlightens it. But to do so we must be channeling these thoughts ourselves - and that is why I hope to do a residency at The School of Making Thinking. I love the idea of being in a place to run wild, physically and intellectually, and seeing where that takes me and my work.
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)

###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)
"Well, I would like to write, and interact, and write, and interact, and write. I have a New England story in my head - but I need to get out of NYC and stand on New England dirt to give it space to be born. 
 
I've also long had this idea of open air plays for a small audience. For instance staging Tennessee Williams ""27 Wagons Full of Cotton"" on a back porch at dusk. I love the idea of an audience that is out in the weather - feeling the air on their skin in a really intimate environment, hearing the crickets chirp as the sun goes down, watching a beautifully performance of a well written text. There is an intimacy in that that reminds me of sitting around the fire listening to my grandparents and uncles tell stories when I was a kid. A primal storytelling experience. In fact, instead of putting up a Williams play, what I'd really like to do is write a play for the occasion myself. It'd be fun to even have it be a ""walking play"" where the audience has to, unexpectedly, get up and follow the actors into a field (where the play continues) and then into a cave (where it culminates). Something like that would be cool."
###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
Why is storytelling important? 
 
A story can, within minutes, plop us into the shoes of someone with entirely different life experiences and show us what the world feels like, looks like, smells like from their perspective. More that anything else it can shift bigotry and hatred toward understanding and compassion in really unobtrusive, organic ways. Storytelling teaches empathy, which is critical for a humane world. it also shows you that you are not alone - that the root of human experience is similar. Storytelling is also a vehicle for providing an audience with a little bit of magical thinking, which the drudgery of their daily lives might have washed away from their everyday thought process (thats my favorite part!)

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Session A (BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE // RECONSTRUCTING WILDNESS)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
Hello. I'm Cassie. I'm a 31 year-old teacher, audio producer and multimedia artist. I live in South Brooklyn with my two dogs and my friend, Sarah. I'm originally from Madison, WI and lived there primarily until I was 25. I was raised by liberal hippies and decided I wanted to be a radio host after watching Molly Shannon and Ana Gasteyer host Delicious Dish on SNL. What great turtlenecks!  
 
Radio is my jam. I have been co-hosting and producing a live, queer, feminist radio show called Romantic Friendship for three years.  
 
I am also currently finishing up my M.F.A. in Integrated Media Arts from Hunter College. My thesis is an hour long radio documentary about my family's experience in an evangelical Amish mennonite settlement in northern Florida in the 1950s. It's an exploration into group identity, belonging, and the Amish values that live on in my family.  
 
For work I teach: radio production, new media, and journalism at SUNY Old Westbury, and robotics to elementary school students.  
 
I love to be outside and walk in the woods. I also like knitting very simple things, drinking beer, and making hand-made birthday cards. Most things are political to me and I like to have fun, sexy conversations about life and politics.
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
My longest standing and most intensely collaborative project is my radio show, Romantic Friendship. My co-host, Sasha Wortzel, and I conceived of the project together three years ago, and have made all decisions around content, production and distribution together since. It is both challenging and extremely rewarding to work collaboratively on this show. There have been moments of frustration (and near demise) – but for me, the collaboration is what keeps the show going. It gives energy and life to the project.  
 
Being a live radio show, we are also collaborating with our guests and the community of hosts and project managers at BBOX, our radio station.  
 
I teach media production at the college and community level – and this is also a collaborative process. In this role, I am actually providing space and guidance for my students to collaborate with each other. I have learned so much about how to be effective in this role in the last few years. When I started I was way too hands-on, and stressed out about making sure the final product was top-notch. This distracted from my students ability to experiment and be creative! I feel much more confident now in respecting the process – rather than focusing only on the end product.  
 
Funny side-note, I opened my CV yesterday to update and upload, and remembered I had given myself the tagline “audio producer, teacher, collaborator.” Made me chuckle a little.

[http://www.prx.org/pieces/101233-farmer-confession-booth-i](http://www.prx.org/pieces/101233-farmer-confession-booth-i) 
 
 
In 2013 I was selected to participate in the Andes Sprouts Society residency, a program based on the idea of bringing artists and farmers together to create new ways of thinking about food, agriculture and the natural world. The main project I created during the residency was SOGS – a daily recording project that combined documentary and sound meditation. I also mounted a “Farmer Confession Booth” for our barn art show, and showed a short film about the foodways of my Amish-Mennonite grandparents – projected onto the side of the barn.  
 
As residents of the farm we also worked on the farm and at the farmers market. The combined experience of creating art and being part of a working farm community was beautiful and stimulating.
###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
In 2009 I worked for the Montana Conservation Corps as a Youth Crew Leader. I spent many weeks out in the field with my crew, which consisted of six teenagers and my co-leader. During the day we build trails and fences, and at night we cooked, ate, played, did lessons, set-up and took down camp.  
 
What worked? Silliness. Unstructured time to balance out the structured time. Going to bed early so we could be alone in our tents.  
 
This was a particularly interesting communal living experience because of the gap in age and cultural background. One night it was my turn to cook and I made quinoa. None of them had ever heard of it before, much less eaten it. The next day everyone was pooping, a lot, and I became the subject of many jokes about poop-inducing hippie food. I wanted us to eat healthy out there, but in the end I compromised and started making pasta instead.  
 
I had a more traditional communal living experience living at a cooperative house with 32 other people in Madison, WI. We shared food, supplies, cooking, communal spaces and decision-making.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
I am drawn – in both body and brain – to the “Between Nature and Culture // Reconstructing Wildness” session.  
 
Last year at my residency in upstate New York I tapped into a community of artists and farmers with strong ties to both country and city. As a native Wisconsinite – and someone who has spent their life canoeing, hiking, and chasing dogs – I feel a similar “pull.” And yet, I am learning to see these urges (to country and city) not as diametrically opposed, but as mutually constituted. They exist together.  
 
I tap into a different kind of creativity when I am in nature. My city self is frenetic and pop-culturey, fueled by a turbulent and productive anxiety. My wild/nature self is . . . more physical. Less scared.  
 
One thing that sounds exciting about the session is the opportunity to work with artists who work in more physical mediums – especially dancers and musicians. I have a background in both (from way back) and I wanna stretch these muscles.
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)

###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)
I definitely want to sing, especially outside, and combine voice with environmental soundscapes.  
 
Also: feminist bookstores. Two years ago I started a documentary film about A Room of One's Own Bookstore, in Madison, WI – a place I used to work and one of the oldest feminist bookstores in the country. They had recently moved locations and doubled in size, at a time when feminist bookstores all over the country were shutting down.  
 
The story of this film is about survival, adaptation, and crafty/shifty ways of changing meaning and connotation through time. I'm interested in our narratives around natural selection – and how we apply this biological model to economics and society. What happens when we equate natural selection with capitalism?
###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
What can chihuahuas teach us about our wild selves?  
 
People often think that my little dog is wimpy and fragile. He appears that way when he's walking on his leash in his little pink coat. But take of the coat and the leash – and he is a sure-footed little creature. He climbs mountains and trots through snow!

###Which session(s) are you applying to?
Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
My work revolves around portraiture, both of people and places, within the realm of community-engaged art. I started out in this work of portraiture 10 years ago, when I left university studies and made a documentary about what it means to be an artist, from the perspective of 4 homeless men in Dallas, TX. In the years since, I lived in Philadelphia and worked for a college prison education program that brings university students and incarcerated students together as peers for intergroup dialogue. I was also teaching art in the Philadelphia jails. I received a grant in 2008 for a portrait project in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia, using plants growing on the roadsides and lots of the neighborhood to dye silk. I created a series of 10 portraits of neighborhood residents using batik, embroidery, and applique. (Please see the Kensington Portrait Project on my website.) I will be exhibiting this work in Philadelphia summer of 2015, and will be collaborating with residents to design the exhibition.  
 
I moved to Toronto in September 2013 to pursue a graduate degree in Environmental Studies at York University. My program requires that students create and fulfill research towards a self-designed plan of study. My work is currently focused on how to intervene in cycles of social violence using arts-based approaches. A main question of this work is how patterns of thought and action are maintained, and ways of intervention that can allow for new, yet unexplored, avenues to emerge. My focus and realm of inquiry for this work is on group and collective-based approaches to social intervention. My artwork in exploring this topic includes performance, video, textiles, and installation, with a focus on testimony and witness.
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
In my work in prison education, my role was to facilitate group processes and coordinate collective projects. Influenced by educational practices of facilitation and curriculum development, my approach to research and artistic practice is oriented towards the creative capacity of groups. My practice is community-engaged and oriented towards impact on social issues.  
 
My process begins with conversations, either individual interviews or group conversations, around a particular question or set of questions. (A question I’m currently working with along with others is, “How can we understand social violence as a form of addiction, and what are markers of this historically and culturally?”) From this collective dialogue and input, I work by myself to develop mediums and processes of exploring the topic artistically, and create a body of work in response. Sometimes my individual practice is a form of research for understanding the question more deeply, and sometimes my own work enters back as working material for a larger group process. The original question becomes expanded and deepened, and enters back into collective art production and exhibition or performance.  
 
It is an important way of learning for me to work with other artists, offering feedback or entering collaboratively into their processes. I learn from the methods and mediums that other artists use and I see the process of working in community on individual or collective projects as exponentially enhancing each person’s growth.
###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)
My most recent work, completed in December 2013, and to be exhibited at York University in April, is called “Safety Net”. This work explores trust and risk in relationships. In line with my process of working collectively, I designed a series of performance-based workshops exploring personal narratives in ways that asked participants to take risk in revealing and telling their stories in public settings. Participants gave me feedback that the collective process allowed them to make actions and speak in ways that they would never have otherwise done, especially in public.  
 
I documented the group workshops from above in video, as way of gaining visual representation of how people choose to take risks in relation with others. I then projected this video onto a wall and traced the movement of people through space using thread and pins, as a way of creating a more tactile and aesthetic sense of individual choices and collective movement around risk and trust. I made a second video of this pin and thread process as a form of self-portraiture that then became the backdrop for a performance piece. In this 10 minute performance, I kneeled on the floor in a darkened room in front of the projection and read letters about risk and trust in a personal relationship of mine with an incarcerated friend. (Please see the link to the video work.)  
 
This work was a way for me to explore the potentials and challenges for collective work that depend on the willingness of individuals to trust and make relational risks. “Safety Net” was also a way for me to take risks as a facilitator and artist, because I was choosing an entirely new way of working. This was my first work of self-portraiture.
###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
In summer 2013 I lived for 3 months with 12 other people at the Herb Pharm in southern Oregon. This was an internship on medicinal plants, and involved farming for 8 hours a day, 4 days a week, and intensive evening and weekend classes. As a group, we were responsible for cooking, cleaning, shopping, and organizing our household. We all lived together in a large house with shared rooms. Each person was responsible for cooking breakfast and dinner for the entire group 2-3 days out of the internship.  
 
I also co-facilitated a two week undergraduate study abroad program in La Paz, Bolivia. For this project about 12 students all lived together in a guest home in the city and shared quarters and coordinated creative works amidst a collective living environment.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
After working in the context of prisons and jails and in community-engaged art projects looking at how to address and change social problems, I’ve arrived at a line of questioning on how to intervene in dominant notions of reality. I’ve been engaging ideas of systems thinking of late, and through this literature I’ve discovered that the highest levels of intervention in social and environmental problems is in changing consciousness and ways of thinking. So far I've discovered that this requires the letting-go of control and allowing new arrangements of human, plant, and animal relationships. Artistically, it requires a willingness for improvisation, and as “Safety Net” highlighted, a willingness to take risks on the unknown. The Unthinking/Unknowing session seems directly related to my work and line of questioning about the role of art in social intervention.  
 
The residency will aid in my development by allowing me an extended time to enter into these conversations creatively, and allow me the space and time to explore these themes of intervention and consciousness through an embodied and collaborative process. I think it is very important to work with others in exploring the question of how we think and how we take a leap into the unknown, since collective intelligence and creativity allows and provides for new ways of action. I hope that that the residency becomes a space for me to create a project or small body of work that can enter into my work as an artist-facilitator with community groups.
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)

###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)
I envision a project that involves the mapping of geographic landscapes in juxtaposition with conceptual maps around a particular topic such as “connection” or “interdependence”. This project would engage collaborators in multiple interpretations of the theme in various mediums, including photo transfer of symbolic or metaphorical images, along with the cutting and rearrangement of geographical or topographical maps. It might also include pictures and diagrams of plants or bodies in relation to each other. Other mediums would include music and choreography exploring connection in time and space. The final work would be an exploration of themes of interdependence that emerge from the group process around questions and challenges of social action. The final exhibit would be an installation and performance venue, with the goal of offering new options and ways of thinking about how to define self in relation to landscapes and other living beings.
###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
What is a map? 
 
A map is a way of understanding the meaning of physical, emotional, and cultural terrains. A map can show the body, the land, social environments, mental landscapes, and cultural representations of perception and reality. Always situated within and exhibiting a social worldview, maps can show how people create and share meaning. Stuart Hall speaks of “shared maps of meaning” or the representations of reality that people understand in relatively synonymous ways within cultural contexts. Mapping can be used as a method of exploring notions of time, space, place, and identity.
###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summer
I have a family wedding on July 19th, so may need to leave the session early if I do travel for that occasion.

Session A (BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE // RECONSTRUCTING WILDNESS), Session B (UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING)
###Tell us a little bit about yourself (300 word limit)
I am an academic and creative thinker. My PhD deals with 19th century photography and queer representation. My creative practice, as a curator, looks at queer history through contemporary art practices. As an artist, my creative practice needs nurturing and has been dormant for too long. 
 
My PhD work is isolating, often resulting in working in a kind of vacuum. While in many ways it's part of the process, I am not convinced it makes for the best work.  
 
As a die-hard city dweller, nature is challenging to access. I live near Lake Ontario and spend summers reading, staring into the distance on an urban strand that simultaneously hideous and stunning. I long for the smell of nature, long walks and noticing small things in grass.
###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)
"I often work collaboratively. I've worked with Kelly McCray for many years as co-curators. We founded The Transmission Commission Collective and have worked on several projects. The collective has a ""rolling membership,"" where artists, writers, curators join forces with us for specific projects. Among them, InTents City-an outdoor installation of pjeg's from around the world dealing with the AIDS crisis (8 members). Rare & Raw-an exhibition at the Leslie Lohman Museum for Gay and Lesbian Art (2 members). And, upcoming in June 2014 Hit Parade-an exhibition examining global cruelity against LGBT communities (3 members). 
 
Further, I was part of a collective Shake-n-Make that took 1970s iconography to look at trauma. (3 members)"

###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)
I have lived in several communal queer houses. I like sharing food, hanging out, etc. 
 
While I have had many experiences with communal living, I do need some private, alone space. 
 
The only thing that has ever been in the way of communal heaven is a dirty kitchen.
###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)
I think it is the balance between togetherness, separateness. Sitting together talking over dinner and quiet walks. I envision a sense of inspiration garnered through new people, new sights and fresh smells
###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)

###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)
Vintage photography session with 4 x 5 cameras, brownie cameras from the 1920s, pinholes, tin types and daguerreotypes. Making pictures about the death of analogue in an environment filled with joy. Make shift outdoor, light secured darkrooms where you can still smell flowers through the chemicals. working together and seaparely. 
 
Group project; an massive camera obscura set up in a barn or something. Nothing fancy, just some natural light from the barn slats, time passing, people hanging out and enjoying the magic.
###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)
February in Toronto has stolen my imagination. It feels like it will last forever, will it? Why can't I break through this terrible feeling? 
 
It's not your fault. Winter can be cruel. Ride this (frozen) wave and spring, like it does every year without fail, will come. Hold tight.
###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summer
I can see nothing conflicting
###How did you hear about SMT?
Instant Coffee Listserve
###What sorts of foods do you not eat? What foods are you allergic to?
