I've worked in performance, sound, film, and sculpture/installation, and am currently developing a film/installation project that revisions various narrative tropes from pop-cultural fictions and traditional fables, and explores the relationship between humans and mythological animals.  I live in the city’s west-end with my partner/fiancé and our rescue cat, Atari. I’m a vegan. I also have a day job as an office manager of a naturopathic clinic, which enables me to explore my interest in natural and alternative healing. I’m particularly interested in herbalism and metaphysical healing.  I’m currently reading 'Kafka on the Shore' by Haruki Murakami. My favourite albums released last year were Rhye’s Woman and Neko Case’s The Worse Things Get. I am also pro-Beyoncé.###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)In many of my past performance pieces, I’ve collaborated with other people as direct participants as well as audience members. Those performances often took place in the public sphere, and whether they were more participatory or solitary, relied on others to help activate these moments.  These days, my work has become less focused on direct interaction and more engaged with the possibilities of traditional media, such as sculpture and film. To that end, my collaboration with others has shifted mainly to that which is peer-based, through conversation where ideas are shared and feedback is provided.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)mountains and hillsides enough to climb' (2003) was a performance wherein I ran an ad for four weeks in the classified section of the Montreal Mirror, a free alternative weekly, that read: SEEKING PEOPLE FOR 3-LEGGED WALKS. I arranged to meet interested individuals in public spaces around the city, and upon meeting, we secured our ankles together and walked. The walks lasted anywhere from1 1/2 to 4 hours.  Inspired by the 3-legged races regularly featured in my elementary school activities, 'mountains' sought to emphasize community over competition. While during typical 3-legged races, each ankle-bound pair are cooperating in order to compete, the participants in a 3-legged walk are simply cooperating. Removed from its original competitive structure, these 3-legged walks brought various strangers and myself together, cooperating for the simple sake and pleasure of walking. Along with having to negotiate factors such as touch, stride length, speed, and direction, the insertion of our temporarily conjoined bodies into a familiar locale facilitated a re-imagining of how to aimlessly wander the city.  'enough to cross, enough to last' (2007) took place in Banff, Alberta, and was an extension of 'mountains'. For this performance, I solicited certified hiking guides to go on private 3-legged hikes with me. The hikes lasted 1 1/2 to 4 hours, and took place on various trails of different levels of elevation gain and intensity. During our hikes, the guides provided a verbal narrative of the trails we were on. Along with the physical challenges of navigating mountainous terrain while bound at the ankle, my intention was to complicate the assumed manner in which official tours of Banff trails were normally experienced, and present a form of new logic with the insertion of two temporarily and purposefully conjoined bodies in the landscape. [http://beckyip.ca/enough-to-cross-enough-to-last](http://beckyip.ca/enough-to-cross-enough-to-last)###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)I’ve spent some time volunteering on organic farms through the organization, WWOOF. One summer a few years ago, I volunteered on a few organic farms throughout Ontario with a friend. One of our stops was at an eco education centre in Eastern Ontario called Earthwalk. The centre attracted different people who arrived and left at different times. Some of us slept inside and some of us tented outside. Meals were prepared, eaten, and cleaned up together. Each meal took place at the dining room table. We would begin by choosing someone to select a card from the Angel Oracle deck to read aloud. Then, each of us would state an intention or reflection, and together, we’d give thanks before eating. This centre was also in the early stages of building an eco village about an hour’s drive north of where we were. We travelled to the village together, set up camp, and spent some time volunteering there as well.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)I've always been interested in the interstices between official, unauthorized, and imagined narratives, and in exploring the ghosts of memory, history and place. In my current work, I’ve begun to explore plant and animal cultures, folklore, and symbolism as they relate to personal history and mythology. I’m also interested in the complex relationship between plants, animals and humans, and in exploring their implications in artistic practice and daily life.  A thematic and technical departure from my previous work, these current investigations are also informed by my own relationship to plants and animals, mythological and real. Participating in ‘Between Nature and Culture // Reconstructing Wildness’ would allow me to deeply consider my relationship to the natural world and wildness in all its forms in tandem with my relationship to my work. In investigating the possibilities of wilding and my inner wildness along with other participants in the Catskills, this session would facilitate a much-needed opportunity for conversation, contemplation, and instill renewal and wonder in my creative practice and development.###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead.

My art is all about self-identification, but my artwork is never about me. I utilize my person as a mark to allow others to recognize their own form of life: I become their medium. I am always very clear about that. As the only child in my family, I want to describe my loneliness, and the pressure my generation encounters. We, as twenty first century generation, have no choice – we need to be confidence, and as the fastest speed as we can to catch the new industrial revolution and new technology. We can’t wait creating the mass productions and want everything in the fast roll. Yet what is the result, what’s the intention to live life in this way? The whole country of China seems like so peaceful, but we actually are not as happy as we seem to be. Our natural environment got destroyed; the pure religion got destroyed; we are crashing everything ……  Personal becomes political. What I am doing, and when I am doing, become a political theme. As the patriarchal society in China, I choose the famous and strange places to take a photo of myself jumping in the air, and do the same pose like the sculpture I discover. I want to make something ironic to question the reality: what is right? Why do I do something just like other people expect me of doing? What is the reality? Is that my sculpture or the person jumping in the air?  My current body of work explores: Chinese culture versus American culture, my female sex versus abstract sculptures, and Chinese Communism politics versus only one child generations. My ironic performances isolate myself as a female in China within extreme natural landscapes, such as the Yinchuan desert and the Qin Shi Huang mausoleum. My practice deals with issues of identity, politics, cross-culturalism, and the surrealistic characteristics of my body in the ever - changing environment.###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative?

My work has undergone the process of being purely representational to becoming phenomenological in essence, hence sometimes immaterial in its brief experientiality. I am after embodied research, walking being my prime methodological tool. My practice aims to find ways to communicate my belief that the process of thinking is yet another sense, and not the purely mental activity that rationality is understood as in our culture. It attempts to find ways of reuniting the body and the mind through work that is both experiential and intellectual in nature and reception. I am interested in hybridity and impure systems as ways of survival and endurance —mainly as sources of sustenance. I find duality and established categories of subjectivity/objectivity to be at the core of Western culture’s inadaptability to the future on earth. I am searching for ways of being in the world that are less dysfunctional, both as an individual and within the social as body. My practice is geared towards building opportunities to nourish one or several of the means of experience a person has available to align, disalign, realign, that person’s patterns, including myself. It aims to find ways to attune to behaviors and find transformative ways to new ones. Lately I am focused on the process of being in nature and spending time with it as a learning possibility to enable behavioral awareness and change. I believe a critical/rational understanding of any given situation needs to be coupled with an experiential and embodied process. The benefits brought about by a durational exchange nature~human, while searching to understand this relationships from a non-hierarchical perspective, will allow a more balanced understanding and mode of being. I hope this therapeutic process will bring reciprocity to the relationship.###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)I believe in the interrelatedness of all live and inert beings. In this sense existence is a collaboration between a particular space and time and a particular state of being within a dynamic system —all in constant flux. This engenders positive and/or negative, long-term and/or immediate, outcomes. Within this framework, and speaking only of intra-species collaborations, I collaborate daily with my family, friends, peers, colleagues, neighbors and fellow New Yorkers as well as with absolute strangers, aiming to have the scale lean towards the positive —nurturing the life aspect. On the creative/intellectual side, as a process where 2 or more persons tackle together an idea from different viewpoints, working within a set of similar parameters and the common will to an outcome of sorts in mind —with partial or total effacement of individual authorships— I see my practice as highly collaborative. Formally and phenomenological I have consciously engaged in collaborative work with colleagues in walks, writing poems, and composing music/performances under the framework of indeterminacy and blind collaboration that Cage and Cunningham are well known for. I have also collaborated in a formal curatorial project for the exhibition “Notations, the Cage Effect Today,” and informal events involving communal walking, foraging and cooking (“What mushroom? What Leave?”). I am currently researching embodiment as knowledge generator in collaboration with an artist/preacher, engaging in field and theoretical research walks; and participate in a collaborative shifting group (IWT) for specific projects. I consider exchanging feedback about specific work —as in a studio visit— to be a collaboration of sorts. Also I highly consider the visible/experiential portion of my practice to be collaborative in a dialogical sense, in that participants are invited to take part as conscientious performers where the outcome is dependent on the participant, yet indeterminate and open.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)PRESENT, 2008-09; MoMA PS1, NY. During 9 months I sat for four hours at a time reading to myself (full list of titles here [http://bibicalderaro.com/artwork/1426296_Present.html](http://bibicalderaro.com/artwork/1426296_Present.html)) and writing my instantaneous thoughts in a typewriter. I was searching for the roots of the financial collapse of 2008-09 in our economic system: Greek philosophy, the Enlightenment; reason as pure thought; reason as only possibility for thought and knowledge; ethics and epistemology. The writings were offered to the public as a gift, a copy of all typewritten pages given away was kept aside and later bound together in an artist book, and published in the paperback PRESENT. All typewritten pages are now an expanded poem that resides in the homes of those who attended the performance. PRESENT is a multidimensional performed essay where I attempted to reduce the exuberance of thought to words; it’s a durational poem that gives thought a chance to communicate; it’s language as membrane and thought as sense; it’s a bridge between the left and right hemispheres, between the rational and the intuitive, between the past and the present, between form as stasis and form as a floating, changing dimension.  -WALKING AS KNOWLEDGE (text~walking), 2013, Bs.As. Argentina This performance revolved around the reactivation of texts selected from Librioteca Pineal ([http://www.ciacentro.org/node/1239](http://www.ciacentro.org/node/1239)). LP houses books about aesthetics, theories of perception, epistemology and environmental ethics. Fifteen artists were invited to participate in a collaboration that was part chance, part agency, as we walked, read and interacted with the urban environment. The participants chose titles from LP to do loud readings at first sight within the group, in the street. The weaving of texts juxtaposed with the street landscapes and changing neighborhoods makes walking a way of knowing as performatic process.###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)My most recent determined isolated act of communal living was participating in the Walking Seminar, during the summer of 2013, in Puerto Rico. The WS was a pedagogical experiment that invited 12 international artists to participate during 3 weeks of walking in PR. We walked out of San Juan heading East and South, camping at unspecified sites for 3-4 nights at a time. The exposure to the intimacy and endurance of camping in non-campground places, without running water or bathroom, challenged the group in severe ways —many members had never camped before. As well, exposure to differing cultural patterns and language barriers made this experience an interesting mini-social laboratory. Individual and group responsibility, ethics and trust are key components that I highlight as important elements in a communal living experience that thrives to engage the creative. The WS lacked the organization and transparency needed to allow or support these. Yet, my own personal synthesis of this experience recovers the incredible potential of camping as restorative and creative process —both at an individual and group level— while understanding the importance of a clear mission statement and the need for determined facilitation of leadership —or, again, the clear disclosure of its absence.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)My practice is based on the liminal spaces of the in-between —the gaps left by silence and non-doing— to understand processes of formation and transformation of body, thought and matter. I work on such fluctuating processes understood within the biological construct of the membrane as hinge, bridge, connector, to contextualize the production and categorization of knowledge and of being. Currently I’m searching to make sense of thinking as another perceptual sense with which humans are equipped to experience and “know” the world. I’m also after understanding how being in nature can develop into a process of reciprocal attunement that facilitates changing old behaviors and/or inventing new ones, including that of thinking. Methods to create new patterns of thought and behavior interest me in particular, in the search for truly innovative ways of being in the world oriented to an ecology based on post-humanist ethics.  Thinking/not thinking and knowing/not knowing are fluid concepts that may happen in solitude yet may be enhanced by dialogic correspondences with people and environment. The process of communicating any such instances require at some point the need of naming; this use of thinking in its making is of utmost importance in my practice. I would like to be able to further challenge this understanding as a methodology and pedagogy. Also, in practicing this understanding, I would like to help shape its theory.  Participating in this residency would allow me to collaborate with fellow artists and thinkers in this direction, while developing an understanding of differences that will make any theory and practice more robust. To engage in knowing/not knowing, thinking/not thinking, naming/not naming within a durational, immersive experience would immensely help shape the research I am proposing as a practitioner of art and thought.###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead.

What interests me is the embodied nature of the dialogical self, how we embody experience from perceptions that become emotions and behaviors, into fabricating “knowledge,” sets of paradigms fixed to a given reality. Walking in nature as method of realigning emotion/behavior/knowledge production into a dynamic understanding of sets may bring answers.###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summer###How did you hear about SMT?I don't remember! but I'm happy I did###What sorts of foods do you not eat?

I think of my work as a construction of processes or encounters that mean to reach a state of questions. Through creating opened games that take participants out of their comfort zones, I experiment different possibilities of interactions with the other, what is around and the idea of intensity. These processes might or might not be documented and can take forms such as video, installation, performance, interactions, happenings and other hybrid ones. I was living in New York for that last 2 years while doing an MFA program in Fine Arts at SVA and just moved back to Rio de Janeiro. I will have my first solo museum show in Rio this month, after winning a grant from Caixa Cultural.###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)My practice is all about human interactions and does not happen without the other. In my pieces I have the role of a “proposer” or someone who sets up the parameters for the processes to happen, and these processes only happen when there are other people. I also work with collaboratos who help me with more specific expertises that my work might need – technology, camera, sound, building spaces, etc.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)Thoughtfeeling workshops were first developed at SMT in 2012 and I have been reshaping them according to space and people since then. These are long silent interactions for 2 people (preferably strangers) with a specific space exploring the notions of spasms of life, presence, closeness and sleep. The workshops are site specific and the space around is a strong influence on what will happen. Participants have their notebooks to communicate through writing with each other and have to stare at each other’s eyes for the whole experience. Thoughtfeeling workshops are not documented.###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)School of Making Thinking 2012.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)Thinking x feeling, individual x group, discussion x meditation and immersions are very relevant topics of questions that come out in my work.

Being involved in experiences myself is fundamental for what I am proposing and the hybrid structure that is proposed here really interest me. Also, I am very curious to be introduced to concepts by Deleuze, Roberto Freire and Paulo Freire in a non academic way.###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead.

My father is a first-generation Iranian immigrant to the United States. My mother is American. Language in my household was frequently confused. My father’s first language is Farsi. Often, I heard Farsi spoken but I did not know how to access its meaning; I was not taught the language. Its sounds, unfamiliar and pure, were structured in a rhythm and pace that felt like a secret code. How do you access meaning if you do not know the code?   The entanglement of movement and my creative impulses started to highly develop at age ten when I decided I wanted to be a modern dancer; I dedicated myself to serious study. I played the role of pantomime, reaching out to express while keeping silent. In my late teens, I developed anorexia and bulimia.   Developing my illness and getting help was a realization that I did not know how to speak; I never had a voice of my own. During my undergraduate studies, I delved inward trying to find what was important to me. The answer came back to language and movement, but now embodying images and sounds.   Working with the moving image is a complex process in structure-making and concept-building. I often think of my process as a form of collage. Ultimately, my work questions authority: who or what is visible/heard, and who or what is invisible/unheard. How do these positions create an in/ability of action?   In Fall 2013, as an Iowa Arts Fellow, I initiated my studies at the University of Iowa in the MFA Film and Video Production program. I am exploring the moving image as a language, which communicates voice as a body of image and sound structures.###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)Collaboration appears throughout my practice in many forms. In one sense, there is the collaboration between my conceptions and the technology I am engaging with to manifest these visions. Experimentation with formatting, software platforms, sound feedback, etc require a lot of trial-and-error and manipulation of various tool sets. Working with equipment, keeping footage organized, and consistently locatable is a constant challenge I face and without digital technology I would not be able to do what I do.   In another sense, when I am constructing a video piece, getting feedback from my peers and professors is an important ongoing conversation I engage with. This allows for an open forum of thought to be presented while also helping me question what I am making, really helping me see what is in front. Work can become difficult to read during the process of its making. Having a few voices you trust to help you sift through the mess of thoughts going on in one’s head is a great help.  Lastly, as far as working with another on a collaborative project, I am currently incorporating more hands-on multi-crew projects. Working in the theatre and designing sound for a stage play was a jump in another medium completely, but engaging with a community of artists who posed many questions to me to were looking for answers I could provide to shape an overall vision. It was taking what I know and applying it to the needs of the play’s text. Essentially, adding an elemental framework within a framework. At this juncture, I am working on a performance piece with my colleague Kasia Plazinska. Both of us have never done a project quite like this before, so we are building it from the ground up together each step of the way.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)Human Body Battleground Organ Organism, 2013, 9m 30s, dv, appropriated collage [https://vimeo.com/77166279](https://vimeo.com/77166279) password: exhausted in this unfolding  The following moving image work was created in a self-directed production course during my first semester in graduate school, Fall 2013. As the title notes, the body is the subject matter of interest. But not a body we can easily define or depict a corporeal presence. More so, this body is a body of image and sound structures that begin in a state of declaration but reveal the fissures of language structures throughout its duration. The Human Body Battle—work demonstrates how a sense of playfulness, humor, with a heavy dose of biting subversion permeates my work. Here they blend together creating a voice, which instigates a complex set of questions upon the viewer rather than posing closed answers.  Here is the synopsis: Human Body Battleground Organ Organism is an appropriated moving image collage investigating the penis and vagina as disembodied vessels. By utilizing a digital voice to enact this estrangement, a narration of declaration generates a questioning of definitions, where sound and image structures dismantle and reveal a deconstruction of audio-visual form and subject's signification.  Currently, this work is on tour with The Black Maria Film Festival.###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)Every summer from the age 12-18, I participated in a “dance lock-in” with my fellow dancers. The lock-in was a mixture of celebration for all the hard work and effort we put into our dance training during the year but it was also an exploratory moment for us to creatively express ourselves by ourselves, to be the authorial voices of our choreographic jams.  Imagine, at any hour of the day for three days, collaborating, choreographing, goofing around, practicing and costuming a production number with your best friends. We were locked in our dance studio with no adult intrusion on our creative project. We were creating a dance production from the ground up.   At the end of the three days, we had the showcase dance recital. It was a blast. This kind of communal living, even though temporary and for a short period of time each year, it was the event I looked forward to most. Getting to work together, be together, and celebrate our love of dance was very special to me and I understood that it was something not everyone got to do, to bond with those they deeply admired about something they deeply admired and live it together.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)I am most interested in participating in Unthinking/Unknowing seminar. For me, my art practice correlates to a type of unthinking/unknowing with each project I start. It is through my art making I explore a conception that I do not know how to decipher. It is only through the process of building, piece by piece, that any answers/resultant bodies of texts reveal themselves to me. Even though I predominately work on the screen, I am interested to further expand my practice to involve multi-media performance where the incorporation of my body, moving images and sounds will affect a space with which I am engaging. This seminar explores the unknowing body, movement, and thinking that is involved in my way thinking and making at the current moment. Participating in this will allow for bother professional and personal growth for me and I look forward to the possibility to engage with this open forum of questioning.###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead.

I enjoy being able to use a more androgynous name because it fits my androgynous nature (or nurture). I bring up gender initially, here, because it is/has been shaping my work and life-questioning. Without going too much into social imaginary, I think that identity constructs are deeply rooted and mirrored by nature. Without an external social infrastructure, who would I/we be? a rock (genderless)? or a tree(maybe genderless)? or the heart of the forest itself? I would argue that identity or re-identity is summoned by spiritualization/reawakening/rebirth/revolution and the way I see it, you have to find that inside of the earth, inside of your skin. To sum myself up (right now), I'm into rediscovery, however applied, but I'm dabbling with ideas of collective re-identity as alternative education. And my favorite color is all shades of green. And I box on the weekends.###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)The genre that my work is most often categorized in is conceptual or performance art. My aesthetic investigation always involves the human body and its interaction with other bodies, human or not. Most of my projects are collaborative in some way. I’ve produced a few projects that literally involve the aid of another person for the entire process from brainstorming ideas to prepping gallery walls. Though, what I find most interesting about my practice is that most solo pieces become collaborative in the final stages. I think that is a big distinction of performance art from other forms of live art, be it theatre, dance or otherwise. The audience participates, unknowingly or not, in the summation of the project. For example, a street intervention piece can be premeditated and conceptualized up until the point of performance. Then the window that has been left cracked open allows for the viewers/audience to alter the course of the work. A swelling crowd, a snickering adolescent, a snail or a frog’s unexpected interaction can change what is ultimately seen and interpreted through the lens of documentation.  A more explicit and relevant example of this happened during a project set in a remote area in the Georgian forest. The intention of the piece benefited from isolation to highlight ideas of reclusivity and fear. However, I was not actually afraid. On the day of the performance, a group of hikers stumbled upon my performance. The shock and/or fear (due to costuming) that became present from both parties had an effect and enhanced, in my opinion, the outcome of the piece. The link to this project can be found here: [http://amberry03.wix.com/portfolio#!trickster/cnvv](http://amberry03.wix.com/portfolio#!trickster/cnvv)###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)"This first link I've provided below is a project with brief description called Divided Actions. I think it reflects the conceptual nature of my work and examines some core ideas relevant to what can be imagined at ""A Summit on a Summit"" hike, such as mapping, wandering, and collaboration. The project was originally conceived in a class environment to then be ripped to shreds by Marina Abramovic in a studio visit. So we advanced the original project (following strangers as spectacle) to becoming invisible stalkers, think Sophie Calle or Vito Acconci. I liked how it turned out. Link 1: Divided Actions [http://amberry03.wix.com/portfolio#!divided-actions/c16ln](http://amberry03.wix.com/portfolio#!divided-actions/c16ln)  My second link below is another more recent project called iMapping (implicit mapping) that also involves following and mapping but hyper-focuses on the abandonment of social constructs. Like Divided Actions, I am following strangers but this time in a large metal encasement on wheels (my car). There's something about the protective shield that one's personal car can provide. In this context, it's a safety bubble. It’s an external, literal and metaphorical framework preventing my body/self/ideas from touching yours. I give this project as an example for “A Summit on a Summit” because it is an extension of thoughts formed originally from the nature wandering in the first project I’ve provided, Divided Actions. And I’ve asked myself a number of times whether I consider the unknowing participants of these projects (the persons followed) to be collaborators. Essentially, yes, but it’s something I’m still chewing on.  Link 2: iMapping (implicit mapping) [http://amberry03.wix.com/portfolio#!imapping-implicit-mapping/c1r6c"](http://amberry03.wix.com/portfolio#!imapping-implicit-mapping/c1r6c")###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)I would say that the majority of my adult life (post-undergrad) has been some form of communal living. And because of this, I've found myself often at the doorstep of family and friends that will take me in for short spurts of time. More specifically, during the past few years as a graduate art student, I've lived out of my car, had a run at living in a 2 bedroom city townhouse in Atlanta shared by 6-8 people, and crashed the majority of the time at a sculpture studio at my school (Savannah College of Art and Design).   More appropriate to this question though, is my 6-week residency in rural India where a group of international artists shared a space that was an empty library--can you even call a library a library without any books? We were told it was a failed attempt by an ambitious NGO but nonetheless, the 15 to 20 mosquito nets gathered on top of individual decorated mats will paint my memory for years to come. As a supplementary note, chai was absolutely the connecting source for the residency, some would say food, or the art produced, but I say chai.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)"I am applying for 'A Summit on a Summit"" hike for a few reasons. For one, I am interested in Guy Debord's or the Situationist idea of the derive and psychogeography. As an expansion of urban wandering, to wander within and among a sensuous landscape develops this solopsistic platform in the mind. I want to find and develop chaos here. I want to stumble upon and create order here. And more importantly, I would like to bare witness of this development with other thinkers.   My opening-up process for discovering new ideas involves a liminal step-by-step process --which follows van Gennep’s rites of passage: separation, transition/unlearning, reincorporation or reidentity. The process is usually in environments that border nature and civilization, like paths within forests, human-made grooves in trees. The process is often solo, so I question how the shifts in identity and unlearning identity can transfix and become valued as a group. As mentioned before, I consider my work to be collaborative in general but usually that collaboration comes into being at the final stages of production or during the performance itself through audience participation. But it has been atypical for collaboration to occur in the thinking process, the initial stages of conception. I'm curious to change/experiment with the process of conceptualizing prior to a project with other vigorous thinkers/artists. I'm interested to watch and interact with the blank stage in others' minds, and how they begin to fill that stage when actively engaging, moving with our **animate environment. Is it a replication of what is visually seen? Is it possible for us to see/envision/feel the same thing? And aiming towards the social realm of my practice, can our inevitable differences be processed in this way as post- ""ist"", e.g., racist, sexist, ageist.   **Just as a distinction, I don't think I believe in inanimate things."###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)My mobile workshop deals with fear as an inherent part of our identity and how it aids our understanding of rupture.   Questions that help structure what rupture is and can be: 1) The physical body goes for days without food, how can you sooth that rupture? What is hunger in the context of this hike? 2) Light enters the eye through the cornea, what happens when the cornea is ruptured (lights out)? Can you imagine other areas for light to enter? 3) If a specific group, say the people hiking, is a concrete community ,what could rupture them/us? Do we fear this separation? What would bring us back together? 4) To me, the largest rupture of all time occurred as a nick of the skin underneath a mustached man whose prejudice initiated one of the largest atrocities of human history. A metaphorical nick, an irritation that erupted in hate-fever. How do we bring that fever down? 5)Some symptoms of traumatic rupture are loneliness, anxiety, disorientation. Can we orient each other by disorienting ourselves? How? 6) Imagine fantasy without nature, what is it?  Potential exercise: The act of eating is often a congregational meeting. We nourish each other through conversation and company while eating food. What changes when the act of communal eating is merged with the eating process itself? I feed her, she feeds me; she feeds him. What changes when this process is used for one meal? Two meals? Every meal? What happens when we skip a meal, when rules are ‘enforced’ in one of our basic needs?###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session.

Or do we simply seek an equal seat in the house?   ARE WE SEEKING RELEASE OR ARE WE SIMPLY WANTING AN EQUAL SEAT IN THE HOUSE?  I seek release or I simply want an equal seat in their house.###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summerI don't foresee any scheduling conflicts.

Formally, I am trained as a dancer and choreographer, making embodiment the primary application in a practice that has become seamlessly interdisciplinary. My performances negotiate the real with the spectacle and target the psychosomatic using gesture, video, collected objects, slide shows, milk, love letters, tape recordings and most recently microwaves. I superimpose narratives of illness, consumption, the self and the feminine using a cross-referential logic of sign symbols. Either as a mantra or a mode of mechanical reproduction I find it necessary to repeat words, images and gestures over and over. Meaning is never the same but also nothing new is ever created. I enjoy this perplexity.  I value both those things that are understated, and those that are overstated. I search for a real feeling but I also like punch lines and entertainment. I consider performance mostly as a situation made up of signs, which include the people, action and that which we sense (see, hear, smell ect…). I look to create disorientation by subverting those signs. Disorientation allows for re-orientation and this is where we see the politics of performance. Politics are embodied. Lately I am interested in the economy of performance via the potentially assigned values of gesture.   My days are made up of the following activities in any set of combinations: Drinking coffee, running up the mountain, going to the studio, performing my ""waitress to pay the bills"" performance series, eating beautiful food and making love to my lover.   I work alone but also in collaboration with the collective WIVES, performing regularly in various venues including galleries, lofts, theatres and music venues. Currently, I am preparing for 8-hour durational performance titled “digestion/liquidation” which will be performed in Toronto as part of FADO’s emerging artist series “11:45”."###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)Firstly, for the past year I have been considering the performative situation, as one in which there is a perpetual reversal of power and vulnerability reciprocating between the audience and myself/the performer. I like to create situations where these empowered/vulnerable positions get thrown back and forth like a hot potato. In this way, opposites inform each other while equal meaning and value is ascribed to both. I need my audience and often ask them to participate by singing me songs, or closing their eyes while I make costume changes, reading the letters I give them, and letting me draw them.   Also, I would say that my decision making process often depends on testing things out on peers and friends. I like to know how they respond to visual, textual and gestural ideas because I feel like potential meaning is collaboration. It could never be my doing alone. Meaning is created out of the collective experience of something.   Finally, I work in close collaboration with the members of WIVES collective, to make experimental theatre and live and video performance. When we perform together we are one. It is quite indescribable but I will say that this state it is enabled by a certain quality in me wherein I allow myself to be lost completely into someone else.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)[https://vimeo.com/63187000](https://vimeo.com/63187000) This video, titled “yes”, features a mirrored image of myself committing the repetitive gesture of slapping my own face. The gesture seems violent at first but through repetition attains a certain ambiguity and meditative or therapeutic quality. This image is accompanied by subtitled dialogue between the identical images. The two selves both ignore each other’s statements and finish each other’s sentences. The “conversation” is rendered into an elucidation of something unspoken. There is no specificity, only sentimentality. I am talking both to myself and to someone not present. For me this work responds very specifically to the School of Making thinking’s summer residency on UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING because for me it occupies a space that I will potentially never understand. I am thinking but it is not yet a thought in a way that the thought may be a thing and furthermore in the way that a thing-thought might be understood. For me linking a gesture or movement disembodies the text. In a sense it disallows the text from attaining any finite or concrete meaning. It this way it proposes something entirely outside our thoughts.   [https://vimeo.com/81539404](https://vimeo.com/81539404)  This is a video documentation of installment 7 of my performance series called “i feel sick”. It was performed outside the AGO in downtown Toronto as part NXNE ART in June of 2013. I’m selecting this work to include in my application because I feel it represents how I offer my gestures to others/the public in a way the gives them lots of space. I am definitely present yet unimposing. This signifies to me moreover, a certain kind of calm reflection I do through action and in dialogue with others.###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)In 2010 I moved to Guatemala to work with adventure tourism project. During this time the project (made up of myself ,another leader and 3-5 participants) would spend half the week, for 8 weeks in the highland cloud forests where we would hike up to a camp with all our food and sleep in tree houses. Every morning I would teach yoga to everyone. We cooked all of our meals over that fire and hiked to water spring for our water. The project would then spend the other half of the week in a village where I would coordinate volunteer programs to teach art and English to children.  In 2012 I moved to Joshua Tree, California with my partner who was working on a earth dome building project. There I cooked meals for the 6 builders. My partner and I slept in one of the 3 small ‘pod’ domes on the site. In all we were 7 people living on a 2-acre plot of land, sleeping in a combination of domes trailers and tents. We had electricity for a small part of the day when we turn the generator on.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)My keenest interest in the session theme is in the application of philosophy to somatics in a creative structure. One of the goals of my practice is to find a quality or type of movement/gesture that is embodiment of it’s own meaning; movement that does not create meaning through representation. I am interested in creating movement that moves freely through the entirety of the body but is still actively ‘real’ and in so responsible to the situation around it. I imagine a readable pedestrian gesture that gets swallowed by a dance vacuum. My intuition tells me that a way towards this is through creating a unique logic that responds to a specific mind/body inquiry –such as “how can we think what we don’t know how to think?” Likewise, the question could be changed to “how can we act/move/gest what we don’t know how to think?” That being said I think the topic of the residency is absolutely appropriate to help me direct myself towards this particular creative objective of mine. On another note, I feel my practice would benefit tremendously from the open and communal structures of the residency. When I create a performance it is often for a particular context, with a particular audience in mind. It is very seldom that my creative impulses arise solely out of themselves and have space to develop organically. I often feel like I am making a show and I would like to, during the course of the residency, explore questions instead.###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)Given UNLIMITED FUNDING, I would build a large glass pyramid in a field. The pyramid would be large enough to house about 10 people. In this rectangle these people would be executing a choreography of independent and partnered gesture, centered on the task of putting thumbtacks in balloons and blowing the balloons up. Culminating into an endurance performance, the performers would fill the balloons until the space is full from floor to ceiling. Some of the movement involved in this performance puts the balloons at risk of popping –especially if they blown up to maximum capacity. There would be a live recording of the space that would be broadcasted to the outside but re-mixed in via programming to play in super slow motion. I would install cameras inside the space (gopro cameras maybe?) and would later edit the performance footage into a video, in such a way that a narrative might be suggested between the performers and the space.###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)Q: How can we negotiate a fragmented mental/psychological/intellectual experience with a healthy body?  A: Creative meditation methods that do not idealize perfection.###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summernone.###How did you hear about SMT?Through a few friends who have also participated: Morgan Sea and Adriana Disman.###What sorts of foods do you not eat?

Whether in stillness or in movement, the body is the most accessible, intimate and tender medium through which I learn. Lately, I have been learning through a desire to embrace some of the tensions and contradictions (felt most viscerally in the body) between the wild and expansive nature of the imagination and the material realities, histories and political context within which I find myself. I am currently exploring ways of using these tensions as a means for creative resistance and transformation.   In tandem with this curiosity around tension comes my attraction to language as a medium of expression, learning, healing and growth. I love the process of pressing up against the rigidity and limitations of words; the release within a structure. I love investigating, disassembling and unraveling words, and delight in watching them form on a page or tumble out of our mouths as if of their own volition. I love feeling contained by language, and using that container as a catalyst for discovery.###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)Whether I work alone or in direct collaboration with others, I understand the entire creative process as inherently collaborative. Every element, every image and idea is somehow informed by, and infused with, the infinite sources of inspiration that emerge from everything around me that is alive: the people, insects, trees and sunlight. Beyond inspiration, I am joyfully indebted to the constructive criticisms and feedback from those with whom I share my practice. This is instrumental in keeping my work authentic and alive.  There is also the magic that I experience during moments of collective presence in performance. I treat my role as a performer as one which cultivates a space of presence, establishing contact and provoking invitation into the realm or reality created in the performance space. So I see the generative process of creation as well as its product as constantly collaborative.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)One of the more recent tangible manifestations of things I have been feeling/thinking that relate to the SMT, and especially the “Between Nature & Culture” theme, is the research, writing and exploratory exchange I have undertaken since last Fall. This is centered in learning through a few Indigenous women’s writing of prose and poetry as a means of sensitizing ourselves to the connections between the body and land. This work emerged out of a course I took on Indigenous Traditions, Women & Colonialism, and continues to spiral out in various forms of research, writing, and embodied experience.   This project has served an ongoing process of experimentation with the use of language as a tool of invitation into experiential learning. In this way, I have been exploring and sharing how words can work both to maintain as well as subvert colonial ways of thinking and being.   So far, this project has taken the form of a paper entitled “Beyond a Fear of the Wild: Reading Indigenous Women’s Writing on Body & Land”, which I will share on a panel on Indigenous Women and Resistance as part of Concordia University’s “Study in Action” conference in March 2014. It has also expressed itself through in a week spent in meditation and observation under a tree in Oaxaca, Mexico, as well as in my poetry practice.   *In lieu of providing links, here is the abstract of the paper I am referring to, if you are interested:  This paper is an invitation to awareness. It emerges from a framework that considers historically masculinist, colonial worldviews as contributing to an ongoing culture of violence, and understands decolonization as a gradual and ongoing process. In sharing this work I will begin by briefly bringing forth a couple of documented examples of the disconnect between body and land to shine a little light on some of the language used for the purposes of the colonial project. Next, I will show how some Indigenous women are resisting and destabilizing colonial beliefs through teachings centered on the interdependent relationship between the body and the land. As a process and living practice of unlearning colonial worldviews cannot truly manifest through book reading alone, these teachings act as an invitation to an embodied process of un-learning; developing a sensitivity to the dynamic exchange between body and land. Their work asks us to consider how we relate to the land, and the material, psychological and spiritual implications of such a relationship. I aim to show how learning through these writings can contribute to a process of sensitizing ourselves to our environment, facilitating a moving away from colonial worldviews and towards communion with the land through a relationship of reverence and respect.###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)Communal living has taken several forms at different moments in my life, and right now it is through a shared living space in Montréal with three humans and two furry creatures. We share bulk dry goods and recuperate fruits and veggies, make kombucha and communal meals when we can. We share hand harvested honey, reading materials and plenty of nourishing kitchen floor conversation, and have developed several functional systems for division of labour, as well as financial and material contributions. We have a compost system using vermi-compost in the house and bringing organic waste to the collective garden that some of us work at during the growing season.   Every week we hold a meditation and listening circle where we light a candle and sit in silence, followed by a check-in, and sometimes experimental singing, playing or fort-building. We also have a small stuffed spotted owl who we take turns hiding around the house to develop observation skills and awareness of space.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)I have been hungering for the space, time and support to synthesize these seemingly separate practices of yoga asana, meditation, poetry, academic research and writing, and performance. The nature of this course is so closely in line with the work I have been doing that I got this incredible rush all through my spine just reading the description!   I feel that I will deeply benefit from the exploration of narrative through story telling, as this is central to my work and life, from the body-centric learning that I know can happen through slow play, and the insights and sparks that performed discussion can ignite.   I feel a deep need for the space and collaborative support that this residency has the potential to bring, as well as some time to sit, run and play in the woods/grass/dirt/wind. It is the learning that comes through awakened receptivity to the messages of the body and land, and that exhilarating tension between form and freedom found in intentionally creative, collective space that I seek.   The aspect of “wildness” is of special intrigue to me, particularly with a consciousness of the dominant and colonially constructed division between the body and mind; rational and irrational; masculine and feminine; civilized and savage. I have been finding myself experiencing small flashes of insight in the readings, discussions and thinking I have been doing about this, and see immense potential for deepening, complicating and expanding that learning through this residency session. As my creative practice is a necessary element in all of my learning, I also recognize potential for a more seamless integration between this practice and my more formal academic explorations.###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)(Only applying to Session A)###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)Session A: Between Nature & Culture  I would love to create a performance that uses the language and sound of poetry to generate embodied movement. Through this, I wish to bring full, living expression to my poems as living entities occurring always in a particular context with a particular group of people. The process of writing, speaking and sharing poetry has always emerged through my body, yet has not come into full expression in performance; meanwhile, the body-centered work and play I have done has often lacked the tangible synthesis of language. My sense is that I have less a need for money or material resources as much as the intentional space and support to more fully realize this merging of creative practices.   I do not have specifics in mind yet, but envision a series of poems, either new or re-visited, performed in an embodied, gestured manner, and in dialogue with those present. My understanding of such dialogue implies direct contact between “performer” and “spectator”; the holding of space and guiding of a narrative arc that facilitates collective release. What I mean by release involves a connection to the breath and a relaxing of the diaphragm, and happens at the moment in the performance when everyone is together at the same time- often through a shared exhale or laughter.###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)Q: What can you offer to a collective learning process?  A: Through training and experience as a yoga teacher, educator and workshop facilitator have allowed me to develop a strong capacity to hold space and actively support individuals’ particular experiences. I have come to recognize an ability to facilitate this process while allowing full agency and autonomy of the person I aim to support.###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summerI don't foresee any scheduling conflicts as I intend to commit to the full three weeks, even if this will mean not participating in other opportunities.###How did you hear about SMT?From my dear friend Adriana Disman and attending the Brooklyn fundraiser in February!###What sorts of foods do you not eat?

Photography is my primary medium but I also work with video, sound and sculpture.   My work is driven by an enthusiasm for small or mundane details in the world around me that are overlooked by others, hence my fascination with dust. Dust is all around us and all things become dust. Some of its largest components are human skin and hair, though it contains other surprising materials like star dust. (For more information on my dust project have a look here at my website here: [www.sallybozzuto.com/#!dust/cyuu](www.sallybozzuto.com/#!dust/cyuu))  I'm also fascinated with things that fit into the following categories: terrifying, gross, amazing. For example: teeth. Teeth are a part of one's skeleton that is seen on the outside of the body (terrifying), they are covered in bacteria and saliva (gross) but they are also necessary for our survival (amazing.) With the exception of nanomachines picking our bodies apart molecule by molecule (grey goo) or maybe marshmallow fluff I think most of the things I can think of that fit into The Grand Three categories are biological in nature: babies, bacteria, dirt, carniverous plants, etc. Most things about the human body fit into The Grand Three if you think about them for long enough. The human body and its relation to the larger life cycle is one of the key elements of some of my newest work.  I am also an excellent conversationalist and have an absurd love of puns. Some of my most recent pun work includes my idea for this year's Halloween costume: a narwhal-mart greeter. Think: smiley face logo with a tusk and fins.###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)As a photographer and videographer I am always collaborating with others. This takes on many forms: brainstorming sketches and ideas for a project with other artists, interacting with models or subjects, getting feedback on works in progress or working with a crew, especially in the case of video-making.   I think one of the great advantages of working in a residency setting is to get feedback from other artists and thinkers and to have exciting conversation that can spark new ideas. I especially love talking to artists working in different media or people with expertise in other areas such as writing, philosophy, science etc. I think dialogue is one of the most precious and important elements of the art-making process.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)[http://www.sallybozzuto.com/#!hcybaygos/c1n0f](http://www.sallybozzuto.com/#!hcybaygos/c1n0f)  How Can You Be Alive You Growths of Spring? addresses regenerative cycles of life and death using substances such as dust, compost, the human body and plant life. This work stems from a fascination with the complexities of biology and wonder at the improbability of life generating and regenerating itself in endless cycles.  Using photography and video I document real and staged processes such as bodily refuse mixing with decaying vegetation to create compost or plants growing from unlikely sources.   My work toes the line of attraction and repulsion by showing things such as death, decay, and bodily refuse in an aesthetically appealing way. I am also addressing the relation of seemingly contradictory forces. Decay begets new growth, birth begets death and death begets rebirth. The cycle is terrifying, repulsive and amazing all at once. It is my hope that this work fills the viewer with a sense of wonder at the incredible regenerative nature of life and stimulates deeper contemplation of both life and death on a larger scale as part of an endless, cosmic cycle.###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)I attended SMT for the past two summers and have lived happily with many different roommates. I also have experience living at summer camp and band camp as a young person.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)"Nature is the primary theme in my newest work, How Can You Be Alive You Growths of Spring?, so the theme ""Between Nature and Culture/Reconstructing Wildness"" is extremely relevant to my practice.  I am very excited to engage in discussions on topics regarding ""The Wild,"" what that means and if there even is such a thing. The aspects of culture surrounding The Wild are of particular interest to me as I think this is something that could be explored much more in my work. I also like the idea of having communal experiences around these themes. Sometimes I can get caught up on being academic with my work, but an emotional component can be equally important."###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead.

My life has been filled with adversity and isolation, so I consider dreams, fears and anxiety to be extremely valuable parts of human experience. Much of my belief system has developed through a continuous dialogue with a sister who shares my DNA but not all of my experiences. My work and interests are easily traced to the use of this dialogue as a tool for measuring the validity and value of our adverse experiences and emotions in regards to survival within society. I do not believe adverse experiences should be treated as invaluable and often I feel there is an attempt to eradicate them along with a skeptical dialogue of our culture in education. I have a B.A. in Art Education and teaching certification from Meredith College and an M.F.A. from the New York Academy of Art. I have recently completed an experimental animation that is off to compete in film festivals. This work incorporates a life-size, partially animatronic, low-budget, stop-motion puppet as well as other puppets and drawings. Having just finished my most ambitious animation to date, I am currently teaching at a public school in Raleigh, North Carolina and pursuing funding and opportunities to take my animation and kinetic work to the next level. I have a two-month-long gallery show at the end of this year that will incorporate animations, puppets, kinetic sculpture, drawings and music. My work is surreal, psychological and attempts to capture beauty and value in adversity, isolation, and venturing into dark places without remaining trapped in them.###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)The way in which I have always lived my life and created artwork seems to be therapeutically and spiritually connected to my survival and this can also be said of the people to whom I become close. Because of the isolation that I experienced growing up, it became imperative to think outside of “reality” in order to survive. This has both positive and negative aspects when trying to keep this quality and participate in community and society, but it does require the seeking out of companions who function this way as well and there is some magic in it. I have always created art in intellectual gatherings of friends, and past dialogues and dreams have led to my current work and goals. In my animating, I am literally working with others and must access my relationship resources in order to complete them. My most recent film incorporated live actors who acted in stop-motion with my life-size, Frankenstein influenced, self-portrait. My upcoming show will incorporate the help, art, music, support and input of dozens of people. I find that along with the experiences of my twin sister, I am often trying to pull from the experiences of others to find overarching themes that hopefully lead to modern, visual mythologies and enhance the spiritual value of my life and the lives of others.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)Please watch my most recent animation at: [https://vimeo.com/81851033](https://vimeo.com/81851033) The password is: psycho  Also, please look at my website.  Recently, I have spent a lot of time reading, researching and thinking about identity, the idea of the individual, epigenetics, nature and nature, the work of Charlie Kaufman, the philosophies of Ludwig Wittgenstein, the problems of technological determinism, and twin symbolism in art.###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)All but one of my living situations have been communal. I have lived with probably a total of thirty different people, including my grandmother. But my most interesting experience was probably sharing a room with my twin sister until the age of eighteen. Although we have lived apart, we were never separated by more than a few miles until I moved to New York to earn my M.F.A. This was extremely hard and frustrating. My sister and I have been through everything together and most of my immediate family would agree that if it had not been for our relationship, our collective situation might be far more adverse than it is. I struggle always to find something that matches that relationship, but I know I never will.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)"""How can we think what we do not know how to think?"" is a question that creates probably one of my favorite black holes to fall into, and I feel it is a deep thought spiral that is related to all the thoughts in my brain, feeling often outside of myself and separated from reality, not ever knowing when I am thinking like ""myself"" or how much control I have over what that is. Because of this, I love dreams, all talk of them and looking for synchronicities between my life and the lives of others. I hope to find realities that lie outside of what I expected or thought, but I feel that I have to train myself to be open to this and aware enough to notice what I want to incorporate into my artwork and personal value system."###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead.

Wittgenstein: ""Just as a man cannot report his own death when it happens, but only foresee it and see an epic description of a whole culture, you will have to look at the works of its greatest figures, hence at works composed when the end of this culture could only be foreseen, because later on there will be nobody left to describe it. So it’s not to be wondered at that it should only be written in the obscure language of prophecy, comprehensive to very few indeed."""###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summerNone###How did you hear about SMT?Internet search###What sorts of foods do you not eat?

At the moment, my work (as well as my life) is informed by the tension I feel as a university dropout who is deeply engaged with critical theory. I have a background in physical theatre and movement work, and I really don't know what I make yet. I read voraciously. I go to conferences and tell everyone I'm finishing my PhD in Lisa Robertson and the feminist poetics of waitressing (lies! But I prefer to call it performance art). I know how to work with my body in impulse-based, strange, raw ways. I've read everything Lauren Berlant's ever written. I can mine my chilly northern Manitoba upbringing for all sorts of inspiration - digging graves in snow as a lonely third-grader at recess, lying on my bookshelf for hours pretending I was Anne Frank, polar bears, my mother's depression, etc. I find psychoanalytic theory delicious, feminisms necessary, Montreal dance parties utterly weird and generative. But ugh! I don't know what I make.###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)"Adrienne Rich: ""I wanted to go somewhere the brain had not yet gone. I wanted not to be there so alone"". Lisa Robertson: ""So what if she is thick and stupid behind her life. It is not private"", and also, ""She wanted to tell about it but not necessarily in language"". Lauren Berlant: ""the emotional time of being-with, time where it is possible to value floundering around with others whose attention-paying to what’s happening is generous and makes liveness possible as a good, not a threat.”   I'm a compulsive archivist, I've read fucking everything, and my friends are crazy and brilliant. I don't know how I would survive without the glut of quotes I've sought out to validate my curiosities, tensions, alienations. The theory that fascinates me is fundamentally about relations and subjectivities. I want to know how we survive and how we survive together, I want (always, always) to create work that stands as a testament to the aggressive, sometimes hopeless genius of the friends I’m lucky to know. I write as the daughter of a mentally ill, hyperliterate mother who gave me her copy of The Madwoman in the Attic to read at seventeen. I work as the granddaughter of a Jewish Marxist woman who could spin off Atwood references at the drop of a hat but could not, would not, stick around town long enough to begin to mother her children.  Why are my loved ones in such turmoil? Why are they so articulate and yet so anguished? I hope this doesn't sound too heavy. I come from a mad but hilarious line of folks. My family does the best bleak humour and I mean to carry on the legacy, but at the same time I wonder, with Anne Boyer (the best poet, my favorite poet): ""Who will care for the raped but brilliant thinkers?"" (Mother, friend, friend, aunt, friend, fucking hell when does this shit end?)."###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)"[http://hysteriarama.tumblr.com/post/16572083925/self-identify-as-a-hater](http://hysteriarama.tumblr.com/post/16572083925/self-identify-as-a-hater)  This is a tumblr post that I wrote a couple of years ago. I tend to believe that I generate the best, richest life for myself when I dredge up the space to puke my anxieties into some sort of public sphere. At the same time, I don't really find that terror and abjection livable in an ongoing sort of way, so I'm continually trying to find ways to shape my raw material into questions and frames that others can enter and exit consensually. I'd like to invite participation and collaboration without coercing it, or, as one of my genius friends and I discussed recently: ""We've got to translate our trainwreck selves into art and theory or else we're doomed to a lifetime of being well-read, inarticulate girls who cry publicly far too often."""###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)I spent a year in my hometown (the frigid-but-secretly-grand Winnipeg, MB) living in an anarchist collective home with eight other folks. We were the Winnipeg Copwatch Collective, the Winnipeg Radical Cheerleaders, the punk house with the best tickle trunk in town. I learned so much about anti-racism, about the politics of policing, about the soul-sucking dullness of house meetings, about being naked (also literally, we didn't like to wear shirts) with roommates and letting them see the spaces I didn't have theory for, didn't have quotes for, found scary and vulnerable and wanted to hide. In our collective house it was impossible to remain hidden, and though that scared me it also broke me open in the best ways. As an only child who grew up with a single parent, communal living is deeply foreign to me, and therefore both scary and exciting. It's my favorite challenge to undertake. I'm also totally on top of doing dishes.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)"I began taking theatre classes as a three-year-old, and only recently have I taken a break. I'm sick of this break. Physical theatre also throws me into a tizzy because it inevitably undermines my ability to falsify my practices. Life becomes sincerity or bust. I end relationships, eat better, wash my face early and read on mountains. Physical theatre always reminds me that, though I may be a hyperliterate theorist-in-training, I am also an embodied thing. Affect theory (and Deleuze, ooh baby) goes hand-in-hand with this work. When I am moving, engaged relationally, and theorizing my becoming rather than theorizing what I've already become, I morph into the most human, most productive version of myself. Juliana Spahr: ""An attempt to reach the human moment will occur"". All I'm ever trying to do. All I really give a shit about.

(200 word limit)I hated university so much, found it so unbelievably dull, and yet inevitably find myself longing for structured educational spaces, albeit ones that don't require so much alienation from oneself. This is the tension I'd like to prod in my dream project. How do you perform your thesis? How do you embody your fragmented poetics? Last year I co-facilitated a lit collective named CWIRL (crazy women writing in real life, we all met on tumblr so we though the irl part was hilarious, and the crazy women part was a seventies feminist throwback). I'd like to remount a miniature version of CWIRL. I dream of facilitating a collective school-process in which we read Adrienne Rich, Lauren Berlant, Lisa Robertson, etc etc etc (and believe me I can fill in the etc) and begin to indulge in our feminisms in a new way. I'd like to theorize the Belantian impasse, the time lived without a genre, in a way that accounts for my being a waitress, a depressive, a girl who has watched every episode ever of Law and Order SVU. (This is vague. This question terrifies me but I know that with a bit of support I could rock it, live it, make it possible).###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)Q: Hey baby, what are you wearing?  A: Glasses, dangling on one finger.

The viewer is changed from viewer to participant and even an active plot driver. The object is changed from passive subject of observation to a complex character. In this way the hierarchical barrier between viewer and object falls away, activating both the viewer and the object as characters of equal force.   The narrative happens episodically, with main characters who appear as puppets or dolls. Rather than existing on a stage or inhabiting a fictional plane, the puppets inhabit the real world: getting haircuts, writing notes to human acquaintances, dying and being interred, or inciting a grave digging.   Events unfold organically and genuinely, and I as the artist often take on the role of character rather than master puppeteer. The lack of total control serves to tint the unfolding events with honesty. It reminds us that though what is happening in these pieces is the language of the lunatic or the trickster (a part of the mind may choose to hang back an laugh at the absurdity of accusing a puppet of a crime), it is at its core as real as the human experience. Fellow human characters participating in these events observe how they feel compelled by the circumstances, and even by the puppet characters, to feel and react in a way that is surprising, unplanned, and genuine.   These “circumstances” are a part of a larger, perhaps interminable epic. They are an intuitive narrative that asks questions about the agency of objects, the authenticity of intuition, the human condition as character in play, manipulation and perception, and the defining qualities of what is real.###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)My main practice is at it's core dependent on collaboration. The circumstances defy the separations that traditionally exist between reality and fiction, artist and viewer, art work and real world. Much of what the work becomes is due to its existence in the mind of the participants. They act not as viewers of an object, but actants in a series of events. Thus my work is arguably always a collaboration.   Aside from my core artistic practice, I also participate frequently in collaborative efforts, such as event planning, group exhibition curation, and collaborative art projects. Most recently I completed an artist book, designed, illustrated, and crafted collaboratively with artist Mike Calway-Fagen. I am currently organizing a puppet slam, for which I've invited a number of individuals from various artistic backgrounds, as well as non-artists, including scientists and environmental activists. These creative minds are coming together to both invent and produce an alternative puppet performance that will challenge given power dynamics, starting with expectations about puppetry. In this way, the work will both directly and indirectly challenge far reaching and basic assumptions about the human place in the universe.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)The circumstances surrounding Fabro's Funeral represent two separate situations, each of which were a part of an ongoing epic. This work involves a dependency on the voluntary participation of others, a perpetual call and response between the people and objects involved, and the importance of moment to moment involvement. It also embodied a search-based approach to content, and revealed a richness of substance as events unfolded. The piece is not preserved in crisp documentary photographs, but in snapshots, and in the minds of the participants involved. In this way it is both un-preservable and ongoing, embodying the spontaneity of hear-say. The piece involved questions about life and death, reality and spectacle, and humor and sincerity, but###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)I have lived on an organic farm under a work-trade agreement. During that time I exchanged 15 hours a week of farm labor for living space in the farm house. I became personal friends with the entrepreneurial farmer who initiated the project. I have also lived with 2 or more room-mates while living and working through school. Each living arrangement has focused on community building, including cooperative cooking and meal-sharing. During my time in Bloomington I have had a close association with the Bloomington Cooperative Living community, and have hosted events for the benefit of the living community as well as participating in the meal-share program.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)My work has become increasingly interested in challenging accepted power-dynamics and structures. This manifests primarily in the process of work making rather than the content of the work itself. The art-making process begins with impulse and through a self-aware openness (or perhaps relinquishing of self) discovers the subconscious richness of events. This seems to be consistent with the mission statement of the School of Making Thinking, and I am happy to have found an establishment that claims heurism as it's central maxim. It is because of this self-same center that I have applied to all three programs, but with a special interest in Unthinking/Unknowing, which seems to speak to the heart of my work most directly, but also seems to be applicable to a broader practice outside of the residency program.###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)"My work is centrally interested in allowing the spontaneous to unfold, which is one of the integral focuses of the hike. I'm also very interested in non-homocentric perspectives--that is to say, the investigation of the universe that does not place the human at it's center. Ideally I'd like to craft an experience to take place during the hike that allows this perspective to be fully experienced. This may focus on the environmentalist value of ""bio-centrism"", but it may also be related to the broader view of ""selflessness"" in its most deconstructed and broadly applicable form."###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)I have up to this point enjoyed drawing from an attitude of resourcefulness, relying on the appropriation of cast-off and discarded items. I find that this practice brings charged objects to the work; objects that carry their history and character with them. This is almost stubbornly low-cost at times. Given unlimited funding, I think I may still choose to work in this way, re-using items that are obtained without cost as a rule. Funding, however, could be utilized in this situation for transportation of items typically more difficult to obtain. This might create an interesting opportunity to engage and examine the process of transport in all it's dimensions: its economics, it's environmental impact, and it's effect upon us as objects in a constantly shifting world.###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)What is the usefulness of a question? Maybe the usefulness of a question is not as a formulaic approach to the acquisition of understanding or a fortification of a belief system. Rather, the value of a question is the experience it offers: a question is an acknowledgment of doubt. To acknowledge doubt with no hurry to resolve it is to embrace uncertainty, even to invite it as an artistic medium.###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summerI do not at this time have any scheduling conflicts.

I’d like to sail around the Earth. Up until recently, I thought I was an artist, one that happened to enjoy adventure, map making, self-directed science experiments, and cataloguing curiosities. Once I realized I was not an artist I thought I was an explorer, one who happened to enjoy making videos, writing, drawing, and photography - see where I’m going with this? On the second last day of 2013 I bought a twenty foot sailboat and realized I was both an artist and an explorer. I am currently negotiating what it means to be an artist who expresses through the medium of exploration, and how to create work for presentation via exploration.###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)I am drawn to The School of Making Thinking because of its approach to collaborative work. As an emerging artist, I find sharing ideas extremely intimidating. I’m easily embarrassed and I often sell myself short because of it. After reading SMT’s ideas on collaboration/individuation, I am convinced that it’s within this community structure I will find my ideal form of collaboration that will allow me to break from being self conscious, and instead learn to embrace the vulnerability that comes with allowing your ideas to move from mind to mind. I am motivated by group discussion, and glean insight for my own projects while observing peers critique each other. When working in a group on one project, I sway more to the side of a follower than a leader if the final product is going to be something that requires interpretation, however, if the project is something literal I feel more comfortable being vocal with my opinions. I believe this is rooted in the insecurity of not believing in myself as an artist, and my struggle of self-identifying as one.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)At one point in my life I thought I was going to be the first person I knew personally to go into space. A popular daily paper promised to send someone to space - all you had to do was ask and get the most votes. I thought if I made a video to accompany my request I’d be chosen for sure. I was not. That said, I still plan on being in space at some point in my life. I wouldn’t describe this as the work that represents me best in relation to being fit for the SMT program, but it showcases my enthusiasm and ernest disposition when working on projects that excite me. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAggD8qoi4I](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAggD8qoi4I) A work in forever progress that is more aligned with the SMT program is Rambler, currently a blog with zine ambitions that I post long winded stories and photos from adventures.

To save on rent, three friends and myself found a 10x30ft windowless studio to call home. We had no cell phone reception or internet, we occupied the space with books and discussions, slept on pullout couches, and ate food from dumpsters near school/meals provided by a nearby temple. There was a public toilet on the floor that we shared with a dentist office and pharmaceutical company who would never find out we lived there. During the day we had to pretend we were working, by night we would take over the halls to make music, art, ride bikes and skateboard. We found the balance in creatively challenging and emotionally supporting each other. Two years later I lived in close quarters with five other people as we sailed from Halifax to Spain on a 53ft sailboat. Before setting sail, we spent a week on land living together. We made meals, shared our fears, and on the final night we sat in a sauna taking ten deep breaths as a group then jumped into the Atlantic as one. At sea we were all accountable for each other’s life.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)I believe that Between Nature and Culture// Reconstructing Wildness is a program that given the opportunity, would remedy my dilemma of the artist vs. explorer struggle. The focus on group work is an element that I know is missing in my current practice, and with the aid and critique of others in a safe zone for sharing, I will be able to let go of many self-doubts that hold me back from currently making the work I conceive.  The session Unthinking/Unknowing is something that on a basic level I have been trying to achieve since I left school. It’s something that I think everyone should be working on, but it’s difficult to know where to start. For myself, and I believe it’s this way for a lot of people, the idea comes as a feeling, then the unthought-thought comes to the surface, and from there without instruction, it has no where to go and I’m back to thinking what I am told to think.  Challenging oneself to formulate ideas and concepts through more unfamiliar territories, such as intuition and unconventional learning allows for one to develop new modes of thinking, and expand their creative process within their own work.###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)During the “Summit on a Summit” hike I would like to lead a workshop in telling time (during sunlight) and direction (at night) by natural indicators. I’d like to explore as a group the dichotomy of a sunrise, vs. a numerical time of day, or the position of the stars vs. a number value or name for a direction. These are both man-made structures that it’s difficult to imagine life without, however the natural world is existing without these things. I want to have a discussion about what this means; to comply with something man invented, in this case time as a number, but to know that it even with this system in place, the phenomenon of a sunset knows no time, and is existing regardless of what time your clock says. Man’s invention of time, vs. the Earths rotation around the Sun happen simultaneously, I think there’s a lot that can come from this observation, especially on a hike, and the romanticisms of losing track of time and direction.###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)With unlimited funding, I would create a space that would serve as a site-specific Museum of Natural Imagined History. The project’s intention is to challenge fact vs. fiction in nature and promote discussion on what the general public is willing to accept as scientific truths or myths. Often we cite what’s published as truth without question, but sometimes after years of further examination, we find these truths of the past become modern-day myths. I often find the myth is more alluring than the fact, and as an artist I’d like to explore this idea further and ask the participants to immerse themselves in a world that is based less on scientific “theory”, and more on the Ancient Greek word “theoria”, which means “a looking at, viewing, beholding”.###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)If asked by Mars One to be one of the 24 explorers sent on a one-way mission to colonize Mars, would you go? Funny you ask; that question’s been on my mind. I believe that space exploration is exciting and important, and to be one of the first humans on Mars is an incredible opportunity. However, I believe that we owe it to Earth to focus our energy on causes that will protect our natural resources, resources that are essential to our existence and that are not on Mars. So no, on principle I cannot help you colonize Mars.###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summerIf a bee stings me I will have to go to the hospital, but promise to return promptly.###How did you hear about SMT?Sophie Traub, I believe you two have met.###What sorts of foods do you not eat?

I wanted to be an artist from the time that I was very very young and thought that I would be a painter. After several unsatisfied years as a painter I found myself looking at my paintings and wanting them to move, to speak. I felt frustrated with the silence and stasis of the gallery experience. I felt critical of Fine Art more broadly, because I felt that it was often inaccessible to the broader population and that the institutional galleries reproduced the marginalizations which were in broader society. I wanted art to be something which was not confined to the gallery, which was able to reach out and uplift pieces of society which were not within the art world. My frustrations almost entirely dissuaded me from realizing my childhood dream of being an artist. Instead of giving up I tried to put my criticisms to work in a productive way. I began to theorize relational aesthetics and participatory art as a way of breaking the divide between audience and artist. I became interested in film because it is a media which has permeated deeply into both high and low culture and which is therefore available to a broader audience. I use my camera not only to fuse narrative and aesthetic concerns but to respond to social inequalities and philosophical questions. After many years of making films, I do not believe that I will ever completely answer my questions of institutional power, hierarchy and populism through my media. Instead I do not look for answers but seek to remain sensitive and open. I try to let my questions continually to reformulate themselves which forces me to reformulate my media and aesthetics to respond. Giving up painting was important for me because it taught me that being open to change allows opportunities for unexpected transformation.###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)I think that people are not the authors of their own thoughts because our sentiments are the furnishings of broader ideological forces. In this manner all thought is collaborative, because meaning is created within a web which extends beyond the individual. In my practice as a filmmaker I see my camera as a relational entity within which this ideology has been inscribed.  I believe that filmic works whether artistic or commercial exist in a dialogue with the broader ideological forces because film is a mass artform, which serves not only to entertain but also to control, to govern and to design our representations. I am interested in responding to these ideologies, whether they be consumeristic, political or social within the medium of film because I see it as a site specific interrogation.   The practice of making a film is inherently collaborative as it is created by many individuals in a network. As a filmmaker I have had to reach out to many communities I was previously unfamiliar with. In advertising for actors on the internet, meeting crew members who are willing to work for free, or in exchange for my work on their project I have extended beyond myself. The subjectivities of these many collaborators are then integrated into the content of the project itself extending the ideological references beyond those which I have personalized.   Particularly through my use of non-actors in dramatic roles I have found that identity is not an expression of self, but a performance of ideology. Someone who is not a trained actor has not learned to unpack their concepts of self and when they play a character they surface. I want to access these surfacings because they are the runoff of glacial beliefs systems which mould the individual. As someone who has acted in my own films, or had my close personal relationships translated into narrative I have been fascinated to watch the strange formations of ideology surface.   Collaboration has been essential to my art practice because I think that my work is more relevant if it is challenged by forces which are beyond my personal sentiments. I have written many of my projects in direct collaboration with other artists and invited strangers into my editing suites. I like collaboration not only because of its philosophical qualities, but also because I like to feel stimulated and challenged by other people.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)I am applying for the Unthinking/Unknowing seminar between July 1st and 21st because I am interested in questioning my preconceptions, working in collaboration and ultimately approaching thinking as concept. As an example of my relevant work I will provide my most recent film, entitled the Excruciating Beauty of Melody which considers irrationalism as a form of anti-knowledge through we may gain clearer insight. I would like to provide a link to the film and recommend that because the film is 25 minutes long, if the jury only has a limited time they watch from 18:00 forward.   [http://vimeo.com/73748392](http://vimeo.com/73748392)  Inspired from a real delusion, the film follows the life of a young man who believes that his body is becoming a musical instrument. The score is of the film is his personal soundtrack- a piano which begins to haunt him, at first from the distance and then moving closer, until it is inside of him. This film was loosely based on a story from my family which has been told and retold, detailing a schizophrenic episode which my Uncle Elroy in which he believed that he could play the piano on his teeth. I had been fascinated with this story for years and as I came of age as an artist and feminist particular themes in this story began to interest me. The music which Elroy heard, elicited from his body seemed to be a unique way of knowing the body which is outside of the confines of gender. I believe that sexuality has been narrowed through the binary system of gender, which covers over the hidden meanings of the body and narrows the pluralities of identity. My Uncle Elroy had a girlfriend named Laura during his formative experience with schizophrenia whom he still talks about today, 40 years later. I sought to portray this music as a form of anti-knowledge, which helped both Laura and Elroy efface their gendered knowledge of their bodies and move into a unknown place in which they might allow the hidden meaning of their bodies to surface.###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)I currently live in communal housing with two other artists. Together we share a house which was built in 1895 around the time which my hometown of Winnipeg, Canada was being settled. I find our home to be a source of personal nourishment and inspiration. Together we form a micro-community which connects to a larger constellation of art, thought and radicalism in the city of Winnipeg. In the past I have had communal living experiences through living on intentional communities in both California and Oregon. Both of these communities were on eco-farms where the community grew and harvested their own food.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)I am applying to the Unthinking/Unknowing residency because on a fundamental level my art is fed by theoretical practice and I am interested in exploring this from the standpoint of a critical pedagogy. I am interested in Deleuze’s concept that thinking is an exercise which demands that one create a place of unknowing in which unexpected discourses may arise. It makes sense to me that unknowing itself would be the basis for thinking because I believe that the sentiments of an individual are often the furnishings of a wider ideology. These sentiments themselves do not necessarily constitute thinking. I think that one must become self conscious of this ideology in order to make contact with the realm of thought.. Reading and writing are by big parts of my practice as an artist, but I know that there are different ways to know things which transcends these modes. I feel that art should be more integrated into daily life, including our personal behaviours and daily relationships.This workshop provides an opportunity for participants to reconfigure knowledge into more foundational areas of our lives including our relationships to ourselves and to one another.###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)In the past I have used the technique of casting to create a form of sculpture which combines figurative sculpture, with burning wax and digital projection. I know that this seems difficult to envision so please consult the following link.   [http://vimeo.com/46888685](http://vimeo.com/46888685)  To create this sculpture I poured wax into a cast which was taken from my head. I then inserted a wick into the hot wax, giving my head a certain mortality as the burning wick of the candle melts away the wax. I then projected a video of myself onto the candle creating an overlapping of representations. This is a lengthy and expensive process. If I had unlimited funding I would hire studio assistants, buy lots of wax, casting materials and additional video projectors.  At the School of Making Thinking I would use these materials and labour to make casts from other participants who volunteer themselves. I would cast from different parts of the body on each participant and combine the casts into a singular body, creating a collage of many bodies together. The inspirations for this body would be taken from the somatic techniques of Roberto Freire which seek use group movement in therapy. I would broadcast projections onto this wax sculpture of participants who volunteered to have their reflections on the the somatic therapy filmed. This sculpture would be a body which transcends the individual and embodies knowledge in its collaborative form.###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)What do you draw your inspiration from?  As a writer and filmmaker my narrative are inspired listening and paying attention to dialogue around me. I am always gathering research from people in my midst and carefully observing. I have been known to tape record my family suppers to glean narratives from convoluted stories and manias.###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summerI currently do not have any schedule conflicts.###How did you hear about SMT?Residencies Unlimited###What sorts of foods do you not eat?

I am currently writing a book about my narrative theories, called "" The Neurotic's Journey"", which posits, among many other ideas, that late 20th century and early 21st century cinema differs from earlier filmic forms in that it offers both a more fragmented and conflicted inner landscape in a radically intimate character subjectivity, and a more collective and transcendent outer landscape in mythical and mystical catharsis, which transcends human identity, space, and time. In this way for me today’s cinema is at once going in deeper and pushing out farther, at play with Deluze’s notion of cinema as crystal, Tarkovsky’s concepts of time and transcendence, Jodorwsky's Psychomagic, Jung’s collective unconscious, the notions of capitalism and patriarchy as inherently alienating, Kristeva's abject/eruptive female and Ponty’s exploration of the body as experience. In addition to the book, I am working on my screenplay, Hearbeat, a psychological thriller about a girl who gets a heart transplant from her dad's lover.  I also do psychic journeying and energy work. I am starting an informal energy work collective with my like-minded friends. I did not study this or seek this out, it came to me in series of experiences that opened me into a very healing field of unknowing. Everything I do has come from a 'not knowing'."###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)I co- produced and co-directed my first film, and I co–wrote the feature screenplay for “Gabi on the Roof in July” with Larry Levine. I am in both a writing and directing group and these have been great experiences. Right now, I’d say biggest collaborative project is my 8+ years of teaching. I have developed my book in collaboration with my students, who are from all over the world, with all kinds of backgrounds. At their best it feels like our classes wire into a spaceship and the group takes off, enjoying an exponential growth in insight that is profoundly healing and productive. I have also collaborated with my students to become a new person. They don’t need to know it – I only tell them if its useful for their development – but they have taught me a self respect and self esteem I never had before My screenwriting work is collaborative in that I do drafts with input from friends, actors, and producers, and in directing I collaborate with actors, crews and the realties of the day to make shoots work. In a larger sense, I think all of us – and the earth – exist in collaboration with each other, and divisions between us are arbitrary and meaningless. In practice, I need time alone, especially since the time I spend with people touches such a deep place in me. So, like many artists I would say I swing between opening and closing – humans and solitude. I’ve been doing a lot of writing and it’s lonely. Its also lonely to do as much teaching as I do since the opening and closing is both intense and needfully boundaried. I would be excited to deal with this opening and closing in the context of the SMT community, and see where it could go in new and creative directions.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)[http://www.hulu.com/watch/389262](http://www.hulu.com/watch/389262)  Hi this below is my latest thing- its the notes for the nuerotic's journey portion of my book.

When I read texts, I often feel that I am more experiential or associative in my response, and I would be excited to explore that work in a field where that is foregrounded. This would inform the work in my book about the building blocks of reality that create patterning for neurotic heroes Part of what I am working on with the book is the leaving behind the known into the unknown in the sense of it being a mix of things that have not been synthesized before in a screenwriting book- personal experience, psychology, philosophy, film theory, direct experience. I am liberated by the feminist notion of writing from the body - that the personal is political, which reminds me of Ponty’s radical embrace of the physical as the spiritual. I think this will lead to a more profound investigation of constructing being and not being, both in my book and my films. Being so in love with Deluze’s idea of the rhizome, and cinema space and time which has informed my approach to my book, I am excited to continue work with Ben to investigating embodiment in the Ponty and Zen traditions. I don't know the result. I know it would be profound, Part of it is that I want to not know the result, I spend way too much time knowing. I want to not know what it will do to me and with me . I want to dance with the course and with the group.###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead.

I can't help but think quite a bit about the different ways we have and hold thoughts and information and I'm endlessly fascinated with how we convey what's inside to the outside. The most interesting kind of people to me in my early life were those who wore their stories on weather-worn faces or showed their stripes through their sartorial selections or whose gravelled voices echoed the sounds or the roads they'd tread. I wanted nothing more than to spend time up near people that had been marinating in experience daily until I encountered art theory at university - a whole kind of metaphysical idea world opened up that gave language, crazy, opaque, neologistic art language to the communicative elements of experience. Ideas across time and space and culture and all that. Then science was thrown into the mix. I wanted to do something practical with my working time and my most cultivated practise was conversation, so, naturally, I became a mental health nurse. In job interviews, when a medical or nursing professional asks me why I made the move from art history to nursing, I always give the same response: Both are fundamentally about communication. They love that, and it's true. I've been working as a nurse for three years with a little break to move to London, UK and work at Wellcome Collection, a sensational health/medicine/art museum and to start a thematic talk radio show on NTSlive.co.uk and to write reviews of art shows and art works and to steep in culture and the wacky anomaly of London as a place.  At the moment, I continue to make radio - show themes of late include Crying, Laughing, Restlessness, and Idle No More - I am also working with a visual artist on a sculpture/installation exploring the concept of the self, and I am writing a zine about loss with a creative witchy woman. I daylight/nightlight as a nurse with an outpatient day program and in inpatient psychiatry at two inner-city Toronto hospitals.###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)Though communicating with yourself is vital and important and interesting, the complications that arise in communicating to another person is what really gets me excited. I'd wager all my ideas are sparked from human interaction. One reliable feature about a person is they are not like another. It's nuts! In the clinical work I do (which is an integral part of my practise), I collaborate closely with my patients to convey or reinforce their self-reported symptoms and needs and I collaborate with a team of 60 or so nurses, psychiatrists, specialists, social workers, occupational therapists and support staff to make plans for medications, therapies, housing, welfare, community supports like case-managers or addictions services, truly all manner of Real Stuff. It is very complicated work made almost fun by a shared attitude of 'help each other!' and acting upon thought instead of thinking upon thought. It's an activating kind of collaboration and the sort of work that inspires time away from work to think about all the action. In creative work, I started Lipstick Studios (so named for our brand of courage, lipstick), a weekly radio talk show, with co-host Angela Shackel. We collaborated to produce every episode until I moved from London to Toronto in October 2013. This was my first creative collaboration and it was ripe with all kinds of material for thinking on communication. We continue to support one another by sharing notes on shows. The experience of collaboration teaches me a great deal about my own work and has changed the way I hear or see the work of others. This collaboration has led to others - the sculpture/installation and the zine.  Relationships (with the self, those in networks of support, civic and community, all kinds, every kind!) and politics are fundamentally what I think about. In that sense, you are all my collaborators, ever single breathing specimen.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)Crying,' an episode I produced, wrote and recorded for Lipstick Studios is the best representation of me as a maker/thinker fit for SMT. In this half-hour episode, crying is explored in a particular contexts, tears in a professor's office from the perspective of the crier and the witness, the method actor in tears, and as a stranger in a new city. Hypotheses of why we cry from evolutionary psychology, social history and contemporary theory of affect and emotion were explained as well as the phsyiology of the act. The topic reached to the heart of what I have been thinking about: the translation of emotional knowledge and information, aspects of the interior world, to the exterior. Emotion surfaces with tears, the effectiveness of tears as a form of communication is mitigated by the culture and circumstance of the moment in which they are witnessed. This project reflects the way I think. I aim to immerse my questions in my interests, the lived experience of others; art and process; biological and social sciences; and critical investigations of phenomena in theory.  The immersive approach of SMT is tremendously appealing and would be mutually suited to my thinking / making / making thinking.###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)Victoria, BC, 2006. Five people plus, three jobs, Vancouver Island's snowiest winter, and no heating system. This was the most memorable of all my communal living experiences, which would be all my living experiences, because I've never lived alone for any significant stretch of time. We used the electric oven as our hearth and read in a semi-circle with our feet propped on the open door. We made vegetable stock from skins and peelings and seedlings were watered with a spice shaker. I caught on fire one morning while porridge boiled and I extended my arms over the element to regain sensation. My housemate Dennis noticed before I did and snuffed my sweater out with a dishtowel. We made bread and subletted a room to an American Jazz singer in her fifties.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)Would you proof read and exercise this application further?  I am very enthusiastic about existence and approach of the SMT.

I'm currently a doctoral candidate in the Ryerson-York Joint Program in Communication and Culture and holds an MA in Philosophy from Concordia University. In my work I gather together movement, philosophy and a critical engagement with performance. My doctoral research, seeks to engage phenomenology as practice: as a mode of embodied engagement and research that enables me to describe and articulate the process of learning movement. dance creation can open the body up to noticing new possibilities for movement and sensory engagement. Likewise phenomenology, as a branch of philosophy concerned with describing the structures of human experience and perceptual life, demands that we suspend the expectations and sedimentations of our ordinary ways of engaging with the world in order to see things as they really are.  It is frustrating to me that academics who write about performance often lack any developed sensitivities to that medium; it is equally tiring that artists who work in performance-based arenas often lack the necessary intellectual rigour to be viewed as innovators within the realm of academic knowledge production.   I do palliative care support work one day a week at a hospital in Toronto. Last week I took my four year old friend, Nella to a dance show and it was the best day I've had so far in 2014. I make things that are true and difficult. Or at least, that's what my mom says.###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)In my current work, I ask questions about movement, authenticity, memory and habit. I am specifically interested descriptive analysis, based on the work of think in how the work of thinkers such as French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty, can provide insight into the experience of movement habits, space and time, as shaped by our everyday encounters with the world. Further, I am curious as to how the experience of learning dance can shed insight into the ways that we acquire embodied habits through our experiences with other people, which are then reflected or taken up in the ways we move. It is easy to think here of an example such as posture or way of walking as it might relate to experiences and feelings someone has about themselves. My research operates on a “practice as research” model, which consists of a studio practice of learning historical work by artists such as Deborah Hay, Trisha Brown and Yvonne Rainer. In learning these pieces, it is my goal to think carefully about how this era of postmodern dance is understood, historically situated, as undoing past sedimentations and ways of working. Many scholars have studied this era in dance history, yet only a few (including Toronto-based artist Megan Andrews), have chosen to approach it from the angle of actually dancing. The central question of this research revolves around how movement learning reveals our articulations of the world and how these articulations reveal important relationships between our bodies and the world, between our own body and the perception of the bodies of other people.   I seek to create a third person window into perceptual experience. In my work I aim to set up heightened conditions for seeing, sensing and recording the experiences of other people. I am interested in notions of authenticity in movement, documentation as a performative practice, witnessing, and questions surrounding the possibilities for intimacy in digitally mediated performance spaces. I have a dynamic engagement with philosophical method: I see this as one modality of articulation for choreographic thought, and an atunement of my dance practice. The intersection of my academic and artistic work is a space of jointure, where the articulating joint is dance itself that in turns lends mobility to working in scholarly and studio based forms. I often inhabit each of these fields separately from one another, but conceive of my practice as being distributed between, and informed by, both the academic and artistic realms.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)"This is a program note I wrote for my friend, Amelia Ehrhardt's piece, ""Traditional Dance"". I'm just going to copy paste it. It isn't published anywhere yet, just went in the program.   ""Traditional Program Note or borrowed ideas from Bernard Stiegler and Jean-François Lyotard, with vague undertones of all of phenomenology and French post-structuralism, no acknowledgement of North American thinkers""  techne = to bring the immaterial into determinate presence or experience through expression in some kind of language, both art and artifice   Amelia is a technician, though like most of my favourite dance artists, I’ve rarely seen her throw her legs really high on stage. I only know about her technical prowess because we go to ballet class together on Monday nights. With the word ‘technician’ I don’t just mean her skill at executing ballet vocabulary. The quality of being technical, here, also refers to a particular way of spatializing meaning. Technology is objectification in the sense that it makes meaning tangible in the form of language, spoken or choreographic. To say that someone is a technician is to say that they use technology. In other words, a moving body – i.e., Amelia – uses a particular expression built through materializing ideas in the language of movement (technology) to make an inscription in time and memory.   By entering into the realm of language, we enter the domain of shared meaning. Deposits into this arena of shared meaning are freely available to be taken up by or ‘decoded’ because the use of technology has both semantic and material dimensions. In fact, the semantic is often the domain of communication and intelligibility. Dance training, because it is just like every other kind of language learning, moves back and forth between the material and the semantic. There is an important conversation to be had about the acquisition of information through movement training, wherein we sediment the sense data of experiential movement by inscribing it in our bodies. There is value to thinking carefully about the materiality and specificity of dance vocabulary. Another way to think about it: language reveals what there is left unsaid."###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)When I was 22 I lived in a communal house. It didn't work so well. Everyone ate everyone else's food and nobody did any cleaning. There were cockroaches and everyone was mad all the time.   Since then, I've lived in a number of communal households but never with more than 2-3 people (not counting sleepover significant others who were like 4th roommates that never paid rent). Currently I live by myself with my 15lbs cat. She's not fat, just gigantic. Here are some things I know about communal living: - Always speak up about something that bothers you (no matter how big or small) as soon as you can and definitely before it festers and you get angry. - Decide if you think something is essential or if you can compromise. - Not everything will be as you like it, but some things will be magically 100x better than you imagined if you let someone surprise you with their way of doing things.  - Don't write notes, talk to people.  - Always ask before borrowing things, even if you think you know the person will be ok with it.  - Listen when people tell you that you screwed up. Try to do better but know that it's ok if you also sort of screw up at that.  - Be gentle with other people; be gentle with yourself.  - Maintain your own boundaries and try to be sensitive to other people's.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)"I'm kind of resistant to the application of Deleuzian concepts, philosophy, etc. when it comes to practice because it seems like in the dance world at least, this largely amounts to abandoning choreographic structure and language in favour of what is viewed as ""superior"" art making. Largely this kind of work is shit and a lousy excuse for people to do whatever the hell they feel like doing because somebody did a really bad job paraphrasing what it means to think about a body without organs.   I really think it is possible to be practically inspired by thinking along with Deleuze in a way that extends the notion of boundaries beyond the limit of phenomenology. Or maybe a better way to put that is that phenomenology, by being so explicitly a descriptive tool, becomes sometimes prescriptive when it functions as a frame for artistic practice. I'd like to explore the notion of boundaries within a broader philosophical context."###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)"Actually I don't think I need very much money for this.   I would like try to understand better what it means to describe the experience of movement. To do this, I would (because I am a broken record) used phenomenological method. I've been thinking a lot about how to make phenomenology interesting to people who maybe don't think doing it is inherently interesting. The thing is, it's all about wonder. How do we look at the world without our preconceived notions and expectations? A lot of this course would consist of somatic work built from a cross section of techniques that I have studies including Skinner Release Technique ([http://www.skinnerreleasing.com/](http://www.skinnerreleasing.com/)) and Feldenkrais ([http://www.feldenkrais.com/](http://www.feldenkrais.com/)). I work a lot with improvisation.

You know, like how people are always so curious about your big life regrets...  I think people ask this question because they are thinking and remembering their own regrets. I read an article recently about how the famous line from that Robert Frost poem, ""two roads diverged in a wood..."" is widely misinterpreted. There's this widespread obsession with trying to tell a person's character based on choices they have made in the past, as if to draw a linear correlation between who a person appears to be now and who they have been. My friend, Shiloh, threw an ""alternate universe party"" in 2011. I went as a veterinarian.

For the afternoon, we hiked a hillside, rolled up our pant legs and crossed a stream and found a special spot among yellow aspen leaves. The kids and I shared some spontaneous, creative play in the landscape. We wrapped bleached deer bones with yarn, artfully placed rosehips in the bark of a tree and created fairy house structures in the underbrush. The kids when on to spontaneously play their string instruments and I made a few more pieces outside with yarn tied to aspen trees. Having created something special together in that 'made special' site, we returned down the hillside, across the river and parted ways knowing something more about ourselves and one another.  I enjoy this spontaneous creation with a site in the land and with others.###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)In college, I moved to Eugene, OR., not knowing a soul. Though some housing leads, I ended up moving into a three story house with 13 roommates. None of us knew one another to begin. We had to figure out a way to get along in spite of previously unknown differences. We came up with ways to resolve conflict, including a weekly house meeting and a weekly, rotating schedule of chores.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)Being included in such a varied group of creatives sharing and exploring while hiking the landscape together will surely be full of conversations and experiences that will feed my creative practice for a long time to come.

(200 word limit)I would like to lead a workshop in creative play in the landscape. This workshop would acknowledge the necessary ingredients to this activity as: a willingness to meet the land and feel its particular consciousness, and be gentle, spontaneous and playful. Working in this way, participants would create an authentic and artful collaboration with nature. To become caught up in the moment of focus, listening and unraveling one's own mind within the safety of the land witnessing this personal process.###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)N/A###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)What is your artistic work about?  To evoke a temporary and poetic presence, I place handmade paper-cut outs, yarn and other art materials in the landscape. I document these gentle interactions through photographs. I refer to my process as “creative play in the landscape”. Creating in this spontaneous way forms a deep focus and an in-the-moment dialogue with a particular site. The photographs that result record a private conversation with a specific landscape and the lives found there. A delicate, visual language is formed to describe connections and tenuousness.  My work contributes to new paths for connecting people’s hearts and imaginations with the land.###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summerNone###How did you hear about SMT?NYFA.org###What sorts of foods do you not eat?

During that time our household duties were delegated by assigning specific chores on a weekly basis. Each week we took on a different cleaning task in order to keep balance and remain collectively taking part in the communal responsibility.

By which I mean, the process of gently leaving to one side our own judgements and emotions, and giving our full attention to the felt reality of another human being.    How do I work with empathy? First, I practice it. Through training in the techniques of ‘Nonviolent Communication’ (an empathy-centred approach to conflict resolution taught world-wide by hundreds of trainers), I learn (slowly!) how to bring empathy into my personal relationships. And I have begun to share these techniques with others by running weekly workshops in Oxford. Participants typically feedback that they find empathy to be a radically different, and hugely enriching, way of being with other people.   Second, I think about it. I am writing a PhD at the University of Oxford on the centrality of empathy to morality. My affiliation is to the philosophy department, but my work draws on fields ranging from neuroscience to literary theory. My hunch is that *Western* approaches to Ethics have neglected empathy, failing to see its centrality in the way of understanding others that is foundational to having moral concern for them.   What else?    I’ve spent a total of forty days at silent meditation retreats. I yoga, often. Last summer, I walked 800 kilometres across Spain in a pilgrimage that led me to confront overwhelming angers and griefs I didn’t know I carried.   I have 1000+ hours experience leading outdoor education with children. And I have a particular interest in treasure hunts (more on this below). I think a lot about how to utilise innovative pedagogical approaches to create deep learning experiences in the classroom. A course I ran last summer on ‘philosophy of good life’ took students beyond the classical texts to visit a Buddhist temple and an organic farm, and to conduct happiness creation experiments on the streets of Oxford.###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)A central theme in my work with empathy is creating encounters between people that facilitate independent working.    One of the gifts of offering empathy to another person, is that you create a space for them to empathise with themselves. That is, when you attentively and lovingly acknowledge their felt reality - their emotions, longings, memories, pains - you give them space and confidence to do it for themselves. And that can be tremendously healing. The healing work is done by themselves, but facilitated and enabled by the collaborative space. I try to create these spaces in my workshops.  In my formal academic work, I enjoy creating a similar kinds of spaces. Typically, this takes the form of exchanging presentations on latest thinking with fellow graduate students. Even if the other person does not say anything, even if I am ‘doing all of the work’, I find their presence tremendously helpful. It imposes a clarity and rigour on my thought. More than that, it makes me honest. In asking another person to attend to my work, I must ask myself ‘is this really worth paying attention to? Do I really care about it?’. If the answer is anything other than an emphatic yes, I look to reconnect with my work and / or redirect it.   This demand for authentic passion is even stronger when I teach. When young people entrust me with their time, I feel moved to provide them with learning that will inspire and empower them (as opposed to boring them or disillusioning them). Thus I must ask: does this material - this theory - really inspire and empower me?   Academic collaboration is also an invaluable source of feedback and advice for future learning.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)How do you turn Shakespeare into a treasure hunt suitable for business executives?  Much of my most creative work has occurred in the outdoor education context. To begin with, this involved working as an instructor at a summer camp for children. It then evolved into the notion of running day-long treasure hunts for adults, utilising cars, codes, spying, and buried treasure. Themes ranged from ‘the quest for the Holy Grail’, to ‘Surviving the Credit Crunch’. In summer 2012, this enthusiasm led me on to a month-long commissioned project for a Shakespeare education charity, who asked: how can we find a new way of engaging corporate supporters with our work?  My answer was to come up with a Shakespearean themed murder mystery treasure hunt, utilising a cast of 6 actors, and 3 historic locations in the city of London. After a chilling investigation of a murder scene (think: dark room, only lit by the candles atop the rose-strewn altar; on that altar lies a cold body, clutching a photo and a dictaphone) participants spent two hours solving clues and interviewing suspects and witnesses, before coming to a verdict. The plot contained elements from Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, and numerous history plays. The challenge was in working out which plot would lead you to the killer (was it romantic suicide? The jealous brother? Or the power-hungry rivals?).  The event was run with their office staff and trustees (see photos in the link below), and received excellent feedback (one trustee - a former deputy governer of the Bank of England - told me enthusiastically that I could make a lot of money offering this to American tourists. Then again, maybe it was just because he won.)  I also once made a birthday treasure hunt for a friend that featured glow-in-the dark murals of Platonic dialogues, and a message in a bottle being discovered in Sri Lanka.  One of my central aspirations for the coming years is to find a way of bringing this creative energy into my academic work on empathy (see below for more thoughts on this).  Link for photos and clues from Shakespeare event (as above): [https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B9JMVWWtLRRgU0xmZ1FwbjNQYVE&usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B9JMVWWtLRRgU0xmZ1FwbjNQYVE&usp=sharing)###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)In summer 2011, I spent eight weeks as a member of an eleven person team that travelled through the Balkans (Croatia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Serbia) delivering sport and play activities to disadvantaged children. We worked together, lived together, travelled together (in a minibus). The work was exhausting. Divisions arose from love and unrequited love. Frustrations arose around the way that the trip was managed. But we survived. Even when we collided with a herd of sheep on a Bosnian road.  Learnings I took from that experience include: people appreciate having time and space to be alone. It is vital to create a space where people feel able to honestly express tensions and difficulties in a non-threatening way.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)I think that the opportunity to collaborate with other passionate thinkers and artists will radically energise and inspire me in ways that I cannot predict. Is that enough?  In particular - I am interested in the theme of wildness. I’m interested in applying to the notion of empathy - that is, to consider the notion of wild empathy.   Wildness captures the sense that in connecting with ourselves, we radically cast of social norms around presenting ourselves. We strip off inherited ways of thinking, to just honestly be. This reality that lies beneath is, in this sense, wild. Empathising with ourselves is to connect with our wildness. Empathy with others is to connect with their wildness.  But what is down there? What pains and angers do we find? What desires and longings? Is our basic nature really a compassionate one as Buddhists might proclaim?  And how to we feel when we encounter this wildness in ourselves and others? Terrified? Awe-inspired? Affirmed? Endeared?  I am also interested in wildness in a second sense - in the role of wilderness as a facilitating venue for this process of connecting with our humanity; in how being in wild spaces opens us up and transforms our consciousness.   More generally, I am excited to find new creative methods to bridge the gap between philosophy and this practice that we call living.###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)DISCOVERING THE WILDERNESS (WITHIN)  First, I would seek to utilise the natural setting to work on processes of self-empathy: exploring the day to day reality of how I felt to be at the residency, and linking this felt reality to deeper parts of myself: enthusiasms and passions, but also trenchant anxieties and fears, and mournings for lost friends & family members.  Second, I would seek to create encounters with other participants to start unlocking their experience of the residency, and how those experiences related to their stories, their realities.   Third: From this work, with myself and others, I would seek to piece together ‘empathic media’ that spoke to the collective experience of the residency, and to the deeper stories of the participants: salient photos, drawings, audio snippets, textual explorations.   And finally, using these media, I would then develop an immersive ‘treasure hunt experience’ to offer other participants at the end of the residency. For a few hours, participants would explore the local wilderness, following clues based around the ‘empathic media’. A gurgling stream might provide the venue for some reflections on the passing (the transitoriness) of the residency. Under the shade of a giant tree, we might find images capturing salient moments of childhood.   This, then, would be an exploration of wilderness of three levels. First, there is the exploring of the wild truth of others. Second, there is the physical exploration of the wild setting. Through these two aspects, participants would be stimulated to experience their own wildness.###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)Why is your application late?   I discovered your program this morning through a friend facebook posting about your workshops.

I find it growing out of cracks in freeway overpasses, and the cemented LA river. my work is designing costumes for film. i spend many days in warehouses climbing ladders to reach clothing hung three levels high. i love the vintage show girl and clown hat section at Warner Brothers Costume. It’s located at the very top of aisle 15 white. it's a rag tag bunch, all crooked sequins and bent feathers. there's a lot of character amongst the lopsided bows. I imagine they have their own wild stories to tell.###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)my work is collaborative from start to finish. primarily film is created to be viewed by an audience. they interact with the medium and the story being told. but before that, it is imagined and shared by the writer, director and creative team. as a costume designer i imagine the way the world looks. each project is different. the director must also agree with my vision. with the help of other costumers, tailors and craftspeople we curate and create a selection of clothes that represent each character in the story. my favorite element of this process is when actors arrive for their fittings. we sift through the possibilities i've gathered until they find objects that aid them in becoming their character. it usually starts with a single item. the right pants, jacket or hat. and then it builds into an entire look. a real imagined person. these elements combine with hair, and make-up and finally walk onto the set a production designer has created. ideally at this moment an imagined world becomes unified and complete. the camera records the results. because there are so many ingredients, it takes a lot to create a great film. it's like alchemy. everything must combine in just the right way to become magic.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)[http://emilybatson.com/the-pretty-one](http://emilybatson.com/the-pretty-one)  last spring i designed the costumes for a film called The Pretty One. the story follows twin sisters. one beautiful, colorful and living an adventurous life in the city. the other shy, still living at home and wearing the faded old clothes from her dead mother's closet. through a terrible accident, a case of mistaken identity unfolds and the shy twin finds herself mirroring her sister's life, only to discover a new more authentic life for herself.   one actress played both sisters and it was fun to create two very different characters who begin to bleed into one another as the story unravels. it's a story of self exploration and acceptance. about stretching beyond the places we find comfortable. while i worked on the film, i was simultaneously reading a book written by Marianne Woodman a Jungian psychologist. the books used fairytales to explain the process of balancing the feminine and masculine aspects of our psyche.  the films seemed to use the same type of allegory.  and likewise, it seems to somehow fit with the theme of wildness.###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)after graduating from college, i went on the obligatory backpacking trip to europe. the first friend in my group split off to become engaged to her boyfriend in florence ( they never got married) the other fell in love with a man who owned a bungee jump on the greek island we were visiting. i found myself on a cog rail train climbing up the swiss alps to a chalet hostel. i lived there for 3 weeks and acted as the housekeeper in exchange for room and board. the owner was fastidious. there were notes stuck to every cupboard and above the sink explaining how to wash / use everything correctly. in the mornings i would do my chores. i learned that cleaning things that were already clean was far easier than cleaning things that were dirty. after work i would go for a hike with the other employees, or ride a bike down the mountain, or visit the hot springs or just sit and watch the fog roll in to the valley below. we would make communal meals in the evening, and slept in bunk beds at night.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)i was raised in a very structured environment. there were lots of obligatory rituals. the nature of my work is quite goal and deadline oriented. clothes must fit a specific body. alterations need to be completed at a specific time. the shirt must be blue. i would really just love to be in a place that offered a different approach to living and creating. it's an experience i think i would find both challenging and liberating. exploring how to allow myself to be. to create something from what arises. it is often an impulse that get's buried in the process of daily life. this sounds like a great opportunity to relax and explore what unfolds.###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead.

I came here to work on two plays with a group of Lebanese and Ethiopian theater artists. With the help of a grant I’ll be here two months. I arrived yesterday. It smells like cumin and gasoline. It’s beautiful and noisy.   I mostly write plays, which means I live in a world of making things with other people. It also means I run away to my room to write. I have a big crush on novels, and essays, I think because I love how intimate reading is – language structures pass into one’s brain and talk with thoughts and memories. I’d like my plays to do that too.  I studied humanities at Yale, and then moved to Savannah with friends to start an arts nonprofit. The nonprofit lives on – after-school creative writing classes for middle schoolers – but I peeled off to come to New York because I missed the hurly-burly of a bigger city. I joined a writers’ group called Youngblood, and helped start a theater company called American Centaur. I’ve found collaborators who are kindred spirits. Lately I’ve been working on projects other people initiated: an adaptation of a Yiddish novel, an adaptation of Love’s Labours Lost, a musical about Earth First!, and now an adaptation with music of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. (I guess it seems like a lot of adaptations, but “adaptation” is a veeeery loose term.) These are all in various stages of happening/just-happened/will-happen-one-day. It’s nice to have people with a certain amount of infrastructure approach me about joining them as a writer. It can be a challenge to take on material I didn’t select. I’ve learned a lot. I love it.   I write essays, too. But super slowly.###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)For a while I thought I might have been a maker of devised theater, who enters a rehearsal room with a set of questions and prompts, guides a flock of actors, and stitches together the resulting material into a “collaborative” piece. Now I think I am mostly a playwright, which is to say, someone who writes a play and brings it to rehearsal. I like following a thought very far down a road. Also I’m not good at talking about how a thing should be, I’m better at just making the thing itself, based on inarticulate thoughts and sensations – I stew for weeks and then write something askew, just so, aslant from reality in some satisfyingly itchy way. Once the thing is there, on a page, it is a joy to talk about it with collaborators, to test its joints and see what squeaks, to be challenged in the spots where I pulled up short to dive deeper.   I recently made a piece in which I wrote a script for a particular group of actors, some of whom I knew well and others of whom I didn’t. They all played characters who had their actual names. One told me that it was uncanny, how close to home some of the lines I’d written for him hit. (I’m interested in understanding that more: why?) Increasingly, I’m interested in this process of writing for specific performers because real people are strange and lovely and tug my writing in unexpected directions.  A good playwright knows how to strike each element of live theater – objects, actors, space, audience – and let it ring out loud clear and beautiful in its own key. That’s good collaboration, I think.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)This is not a project I initiated or wrote but that’s partly my point.   Two summers ago, I played one of the students in a bootleg punk-anarchist Les Mis that I heard about and showed up for. There were fifty-two of us. We lived in a field and rehearsed under a circus tent. I had a few solo lines but mostly I sang in the chorus and carried around a paper-mache gun and looked adoringly at the actor playing Enjolras. I learned to use a sewing machine, I learned how to sing high without hurting my voice, I learned how to dumpster dive, I got terribly sick, I washed naked in the woods, I made dear friends, and I sprained an ankle. All fifty-two of us were putting in sixteen-hour days. I’d come because I wanted to. I liked just about everyone. Still, I found myself retreating into an I sometimes, and the big thing I learned was how not run away from a We. I’s are important and it’s easy to hold fast to an I because your I is what you know. We is no one’s I, We is uncertain, I can’t control We. When We finally performed Les Mis – six times, in four cities – We were performing a schmaltzy Broadway hit but we were also performing the We we’d made in that month in that field. The whole endeavor was ridiculous, and We were performing the strangeness of We’s loyalty to it.   That gets at something essential to me: Set up something ridiculous, and have the perverse patience to be loyal to it. Step out of what you know, and have the courage to stand on ridiculous ground. When you do that, people gather, however ridiculously, and when people gather and work hard and are silly together… that’s sacred.###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)That summer in Vermont was one. Fifty people lived in tents and ate together and worked together and took turns emptying the bucket we all pooped in. I worked hard, and occasionally took time to myself – that was how I existed in that space.   Until recently, I lived in a nine-person warehouse space in Brooklyn. There was no unifying project – people generally kept to themselves – but we shared cleaning duties, and had to make a couple of thorny decisions as a group. Those decisions were tricky, and one in particular caused some damage – mostly to one house member in particular, but to everyone else, too, I’d argue. My read on it is this: There were longstanding rules and policies about house membership. Rules are important. But. It’s dangerous to avoid open conversation about conflict in favor of impartial rule-enforcement. Rules are rules, but people are people, and the chance to hear and be heard are what allow us to live together well.  I love cooking with people. I love standing in a kitchen together, with people coming and going. I love cleaning up together. I love huge stacks of mismatched plates.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)Last year I fell in love with a few anarchist thinkers, and this year I fell in love with a few Jewish thinkers. I love the anarchists because they love the mess of uncertainty, and because they remind me to walk and encounter people and worlds without the handrails of the familiar. I love the Jewish thinkers because they love the creative power of structure. They have a radical commitment to constructing spaces – however narrow-seeming – of the sacred in this world.   The session on wildness seems like a space where anarchists and Jews might meet.  I’m interested in how that space might inform my creative practice. I’d relish the chance to leave the physical architecture of New York City, and the familiar mental architecture of the writer’s space or rehearsal room.   My instinct is that Jewish law exists in conversation with the world’s wildness. My instinct is that clarifying the ground on which one stands – which is what Jewish law is doing – allows one to relate to wildness without demand, or possessiveness.   Because as much as I love anarchist thought, I worry that an infatuation with a certain aesthetic of anarchy (as opposed to an anarchist way of thinking) risks exploiting the people and the world around us.   My plays are always part prayer; they are a form of research into freedom. I am always trying to catch something alive, delicate, green-smelling, wild in my plays, however carefully constructed and rigorously rehearsed.###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)"I'm interested in forgetting as a creative practice.   I'm still working out what that means.  I'm interested in how forgetting -- or at least attending to the spaces around the things we can't remember -- creates space for self-reinvention. I've always felt like I'll never be the old Henry James ""writer is someone on whom nothing is lost"" thing because I have such a bad memory for things.  I'm interested in exploring how lapses in memory make us who we are. I'm interested in how our lapses interact with others' rememberings, or vice versa, and how lapses behave when they meet other lapses.   I'm interested in exploring strong emotional attachments that have been emptied of any content (""I don't remember why I love this place""). Could we fabricate such attachments?   I'm interested in the fear that attends the possibility of not knowing some key part of one's past.   I'd like to investigate ways of reproducing such blank spaces in art, especially embodied art like theater or dance or film."###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)I am interested in a play as a container, and dramatic structure – however loosely understood – as architecture. So: I would like to build a small room that was also a play.   I would use my limited building skills – and perhaps acquire new ones – to construct the room from wood, fabric, plastic, glass… As I build the room, I’d be writing text that corresponds to different parts of the space. A song for this hole, an argument for that roof beam. I’m curious if paying attention to what makes a sturdy room could result in an unexpectedly sturdy but nonlinear play. Depending on how far I get, I might sleep in the room, eat in the room, host other people who want to come visit the room, and see how all that could inform the play. There will of course be chinks in the room for breeze or rain or grass smells and of course the hope is that those things end up in the play, too.   Texts behind this are maybe Woolf, A Room of One’s Own, Baldwin, Giovanni’s Room, Heschel on the architecture of time, and Renee Gladman’s on architectural sentences and imaginary places.###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)Do you feel good at talking about your art? Do you think it's important to be good at talking about your art?   I don't feel great at talking about my art. I'm getting better. I know it can be super helpful to be able to talk about one's art, but I think I also would like to make that doesn't quite bear talking about.###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summerI might have an obligation (also upstate) that wraps up June 8, but other than that would be available for either the hike or Session A.###How did you hear about SMT?a friend - Adam Horowitz###What sorts of foods do you not eat?

I'm a musician who studied classical piano for 8 years and now is trying her luck as a singer in an alternative rock band. I'm someone who improvises. Who has a quick wit. Who likes puns and isn't afraid to throw you one the moment it occurs to her. I'm someone who understands rhythm. Who wonders if I should try freestyling for reals because any time I give it a go at a party I'm kind of ridiculously awesome at it. I'm a writer with lots of ideas (and scenes) but who has yet to write her first full length play. I am a theater and film goer and music listener with a keen eye and ear for what moves me and captures me and surprises me and what looks forced and pushed and cliche and patronizing. I'm a passionate artist who wants to create that which moves and captures and surprises and transports people. I'm someone who thinks she'd make a great director -- of film or theater -- because she understands what it is to be an actor and what it is to be an audience and because she can communicate and consider and lead and follow. I'm someone who thinks she'd make an excellent DJ because she knows what kind of music drives her to dance and she thinks it's excellent stuff. I am an actress who does really good work. Work her classmates and teachers admire. Work that landed her a full tuition scholarship to ACT, and has landed her some great jobs and gotten her some great reviews. I'm an actress who doesn't work as much as she'd like to. I'm an actress who wants to create something.###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)I've learned that the best kind of acting is collaborative. When actors are really playing off each other. The circle of collaborators in this case is made wider by the director and the playwright, and in performance the audience - all offering further possibilities for integration and inspiration. My goal as an actor is to do my preparation, to know where I'm coming from, and then to remain open to how these other elements will affect or guide me in the moment. When the channels are open it can feel like these elements are working both with me and through me. It feels sublime, and I daresay spiritual. There's excitement in the unknown and anchoring in the flow of what's happening. I've encountered something similar in music, which is why I'm now in a band.  Collaboration also exists at a far more messy, less polished level. And the creative work I've done with Clown, Improv, Movement based composition, and Sketch Comedy are examples of that. There is usually more chaos, more mess, and perhaps a need for more negotiation, and compromise. Navigating those waters with my co-creators can become an art itself, but things generally just find a way of taking shape and working out. It's very cool to be a part of that. There is often such willingness in the room, such allowance, and such a unique group dynamic, that the work we end up with is something we never could have found without each other or without the mess.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)"Senior year at Brown I took a class called Solo Performance. 12 students wrote 12 solo shows. My show was called Whitenoise; it was about my family. The divorce, the remarriages, the coming of age, the dark secrets, and perhaps more interesting the stories about my grandmother, her use of LSD, a shady character she dated, and what he might or might not have done to my aunt. It was easy enough to pour out the material. To bring it in and perform it for my peers. But the piece really came together when I decided to incorporate a performance art device I'd developed a year earlier in a class called Advanced Performance. Our professor had given us the assignment ""Overheard Conversations;"" I eavesdropped at cafes, took notes, and poured over them...how would I perform this, what was the link... I arrived at a conclusion about superficiality -- that sometimes we need the superficial just to converse -- and this led me to the idea of animating one's face with make up in order to communicate. In the practicing of it, I discovered exciting nuanced choices I could make. In the performing of it...success! The class loved it. An exchange took place. And the feedback from that class inspired me to bring it in to the next one, where I found out it could server to anchor my show. I explored the construct further the following year when I performed a shortened version of the show - or you might call it a lengthened version of the performance art - at two different spaces in San Francisco. I use this example so you can get a sense of how I might play with an idea, and how I might work with that idea and bring it to performance. Although the creation was a solo venture, without the classes, without the spaces and the people that inspired risk, accepted flops, offered feedback, and hoped for brilliance, nothing would have happened."###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)I am my happiest in communal living situations. I currently live in my 6th communal sitch since college. I've found most on Craigslist, including this one. I joined a 7 roommate, 3 story house in Ditmas Park just a couple summers ago. A house with a porch, laundry, the occasional Sunday night dinner, and even some biggish parties. Totally awesome stuff for yours truly. Then our lease holder's girlfriend moved in, and the couple began fighting and calling the cops on each other and throwing computer monitors down the stairs and giving each other black eyes, so I and three girls moved out. We're now in the top 2 floors of another lovely house with laundry and porches in the same hood. We have dinner parties sometimes and are looking forward to using our lovely back garden when the weather gets nice. Oh and there are no big fights or black eyes. We get along really really well.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)Sometimes I'm told I think too much. It's true. I do. I can. However I have my brain to thank for some of the biggest blessings I've encountered in my life, and some of the greatest achievements. I like the idea of exploring thinking. Perhaps by not thinking. Knowing by not knowing. I believe that my heart and soul and instincts are perhaps smarter and more keenly equipped to lead my artistic endeavors than my mind, yet my mind is certainly a necessary part of the equation! I'm interested in what I might be separating from or letting go of by unthinking. How this might change my approach to projects or life in general. Or what I might integrate into my process by knowing thinking differently. It seems confusing and therefore rich ground for me to play in. It also parallels a theme I'm pondering in my life right now...letting go versus showing up. When to release. When to follow. When to think. When to know. When to not know. When to not think. Trusting. Leaping. Tuning in to flow.  As I mentioned before I'm a girl with ideas. Maybe it's the Libra Moon/Rising in me. They say airy people have lots of ideas they don't follow through on. I also have an Aries sun (opposite sign of Libra) so if there is validity to this stuff it may help to explain why I can be a bit of a frustrated artist or individual. Pulled by polarity. One who has fiery instincts to follow, but keen to consider and weigh the possible outcomes. I want a blank canvas. Space. Time. To play. To develop something. To integrate the ideas and the skills. A play. A film. A performance art piece. Webisodes. I'm truly not sure yet. But I'm capable. And I'm talented. And I look forward to discovering the piece would manifest through me at SMT.###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)"There was a time I stood on the subway platform at Broadway/Lafayette, and I stared at the sign that read ""Broadway"" above this little cutout in the wall that almost looked like a door. I imagined myself sitting there with a pickaxe, slowly chiseling away like a scene in a Matthew Barney film. Eventually I'd find a door behind the concrete and I'd chisel and pull and finally end up crawling out of a hole in a big green field somewhere and I'd look down and see this tiny little rock I crawled out of. And then I'd drop kick it down the field.   I can envision creating and directing a film at SMT that has a bridge between the real and the unreal. I imagine special effects and/or animation would help to most fully realize this, but the goal would be to make the viewer intimate with the main character's mind. How she sees, how she dreams. Perhaps her journey would be about how she uses the unreal to function in the real, and/or vice versa, or where she finally chooses to dwell and why. Something rich in images and dreamlike ideas. Perhaps the film just is fantasy and there would be nothing real about it. Other than the character's journey. A recognizably human one."###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)What will you want to teach your children when it comes to art? I will encourage play. Lots of play! I will sing to them at night and join in when they sing in the car. Any old nonsense. I will make sure they spend plenty of time outside. I will teach them how to build troll houses by the stream and sing songs around a campfire and I will encourage the building of forts in a variety of locations with a variety of materials. I will encourage time alone for them. To think. To draw. To nurture their imaginations. I will love what they do and encourage them to love what they do too. (For the record, I don't have kids. But I felt inclined to write this. When I think of my inner artist I think about childhood. Mine and my unborn's.) And to close I'd just like to add this quote from Einstein a friend just posted on Facebook: Play is the highest form of research.

Also to keep me accountable to my internal deadlines. 2: I deeply enjoy using the mastery of my craft in harmony with the mastery of someone else's craft; to create multi-layered work.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)"MAGIC SOUND BOOTH: [http://audiosmut.ca/experiments/italian-radio-magic/](http://audiosmut.ca/experiments/italian-radio-magic/)  I was at a very serious journalism festival in Italy, where I had been invited to present my work. It was already slightly disruptive of us to simply announce our name: Audio Smut, while on panels with serious journalists from the Washington Post and the New Yorker. Fortunately, the head of the audio department (who invited us) has a Finbloom-esque mischeiviousness about him. We had his 100% support.  The festival was comprised of formal seminar style talks, formal screenings, and formal panel discussions. My collaborator and I created a large installation. It had flowing purple fabric, gauzy pink tool, gold sparkles. It was a portable booth, where two people could escape the crowds and stand in privacy, enshrouded by the flowing fabric and sparkling lights. Inside, our subjects were greeted by a lady in a pink jacket. Dangling from the ceiling were 3 cards, with 3 questions. The subject would pick a question, and each would share a story pertaining to the question. All was audio recorded, for use in future documentary work.   The reception was explosive. We had a line-up of 15-20 going all afternoon. People were asking about it the entire festival: ""Are you going to remount the magic sound booth?"". It was a sight for sore eyes. This project strikes me as SMT-esque, in that it looked at what was possible in a given setting and went wacky on what was expected."###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)I live in a big house with 5 other people and I fucking love it.   I'm really good at doing dishes now.   I went to SMT and lived there for 11 days give or take and I was not annoyed or exhausted of being around people.   I love sleepovers and I have them all the time.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)Reconstructing Wildness:  One of my goals as an artist is to unravel the tight grip that my intellectual mind has on my process. I want access my unbridled spirit.  I think that my unbridled spirit is tapped into something true and fresh in me. I think analysis should come after, or happen at a different time than creating. I would like to practice making art by trusting my instincts. I think this is the only way you can truly tap in to the collective unconscious, which is where the truths-we-know-but-are-afraid-to-say live. Another of my goals as an artist is to say the truths-we-know-but-are-afraid-to-say (or even better: the truths we aren't' sure about, and are afraid to say)###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)I would like to lead a secret luxury game.   I think there is always a near-breaking point when on a wilderness adventure. A point where you are tired, and hungry, and damp, and cold. I would like to have everyone write down something they need to feel cared for on a piece of paper. Then distribute the papers at random. It is your job to give the person on the paper what they need, when you think they need it.###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)I would collaboratively write, mix and master an album of non-fiction audio infused music.   OR  I would bring Bekky O'Neill (qualityslippersproductions.com) to SMT as my partner in crime. We would create a toy theater puppet show, which I would create a score and sound design for. The toy theater puppet show features O'Neill's gorgeous hand drawn, hand made puppets and set design. The story features voices from intimate interviews, on a topic derived from the-truth-that-we-aren't-sure-about-and-are-afraid-to-say. There will be explicit sexual content that is true to life.   OR  I would like to create a sound designed performance, where someone's movements are designed as in the first scene of Daisies.###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)Why is going to SMT important to you?  Going to SMT is important to me because I am thoroughly and completely and obsessively engrossed in my radio work, and I want to break the fuck out and shake up my process. Think new thoughts. Answer to new rules.###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summerNO! [none]###How did you hear about SMT?Sharona B.###What sorts of foods do you not eat?

I started in TV to create a network run entirely by children. that was 1993-ish. I have - to an extent - done that successfully in small pieces, but the $$ has been a little challenging. For the past ten years I have mostly made my living covering fashion (fun). Lately I've been doing some shooting for THE DOCTORS, a daytime talk show, shooting vagina-related material. children's tv. fashion. vaginas. I'm on a roll... and I am loving shooting for other people instead of just for my own projects. I want to build my well spring muscle, the thoughtful and grounded joy that gushes tactfully out of oneself - that is based on one's love for life and experiences and both makes sense and is mysteriously ethereal and not-able-to-be-planned. I want this because I have spent alot of my life creating within others' boundaries and I'm ready to be. in. charge. this is why I would like to be educated in and with SMT.###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)I love working with people, creating space for others to do their best work. and I am ETERNALLY GRATEFUL to the few people who have done that for me. I like to pull a team together based on what each person does well, and create from there. that said, I can be an anxiety monster and that is probably my greatest professional and creative obstacle. I know the way to make my projects be finished well and on time and there is not always the time to give everyone to their creative processes. this is the greatest challenge working with children - the perfect storm of process and product. a brilliant video editor has been MY key to driving the project into excellence.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)I wrote poems and Short Short Stories in my early twenties to overcome writers block. Most of them are in a box somewhere, but are still relevant.

In my first apartment, my roommates and I were the first stop for our friends moving to SF from the east coast. They stayed with us until they found an apartment, usually with other friends of ours or theirs - all blended together. My second 'communal' apartment was great too. We all cooked meals together, had a 'house' grocery list that we all shared in $ and collecting (bulk and farmers market). One of my roommates was founding the Wise Fool Puppet Company so even though I was working ridiculous hours (overnight work shifts and school all day), I could still come home and help make puppets for a while, share a meal that we all cooked, and take a bath which was my then-version of eight hours of sleep. I also had the added benefit of participating in all the Wise Fool events - parades, plays. I could pop my stilts on and go... able to keep my own packed schedule and still participate in and support my friends amazing company. I have also lived communally shorter term on vacations and often fantasize about living in a more collective environment...with children and families or fun adventuresome adults. or both.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)A SUMMIT ON A SUMMIT: This session will aid my open-minded development by dropping me into the deep end of SMT, really playing with other people who are involved in the school and/or who are attracted to the school – a nice sampling of people ready to dive in and explore together. I look forward to being in a state of mind that is receptive to spontaneous communal creation, support, and loving challenge.  UNTHINKING/UNKNOWING The length of time that this session is in and of itself has the possibility of opening me up to manifest creation that is out of my own unique box.

My virtue is the questions that I can't let go of; the why, the so what, the what for, and the what does it mean. As tiring and difficult as they are, I am committed to them. My work deals more with the ""how"" of fear. Fear as a given element in a social life, and how to acknowledge, allow, and circumvent fear of other people that keeps me moving and can push me to isolation. Through my work, individual or collaborative, my goal is to create situations and systems that bring people toward each other. I draw on tactics from relational aesthetics and social practice, engineering spaces for interaction and producing relationships as the work of art. For example, I have worked with Craigslist offering my sponsorship- or advice, presence, friendship, mentorship- to strangers on the internet. The relationships and conversations that were born of that offer are what I consider my art. I value making myself as vulnerable as I am asking participants in my work to become. I consider my work a process or tool with which myself and those involved can grow."###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)My practice is often physically collaborative. I work with another person to make the piece of art. Sometimes this means building with another person, hashing out every measurement and angle aloud. Sometimes it means that conversation is an integral part of the project, and people volunteer to talk to me. Sometimes it is collaborative in that I ran my design/writing/idea by ten people in my community before I got to the final piece. I always look at my work with other people and they help me to figure out what the piece is, what it does, what it means, and why it exists. Or at least bring me closer to understanding.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)"[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B16HTlj0PVuUZ2ZnekhTelF3bW8/edit?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B16HTlj0PVuUZ2ZnekhTelF3bW8/edit?usp=sharing)  This project is ongoing. I meet with people (anyone who signs up), and we talk about what isn't working in their lives, the things that are running them around, or the feeling they can't seem to describe. This conversation usually lasts 45 minutes to an hour.  Afterwards, I sit with what I've heard, and try to distill a theme or trend. From this I write a prescription, which is a string of words and a course of sugar pills. I design the packaging and literature of the prescription from scratch for each ""patient""."###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)I've lived in communal houses when I was younger in Santa Cruz, CA. Sometimes it was lovely, and sometimes it was oppressive. It was lovely when we communicated effectively, and had systems of organization we all agreed upon. With these things in place, I lived joyfully with seven other people in a house by the beach. We met weekly for check-ins about our house and our lives. I've lived in communal houses in which the communication was lacking, or the co-habitators had no interest in maintaining a comfortable environment for everyone in the house.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)I am so excited about this session that I am filling out this whole application 4 days after the deadline, with no idea if it will even submit when I hit the button. Thinking as a muscle, as an excursive regimen, as an occupation, as a sport is critical to my work, my life, and my faith. I want help in entering a liminal thinking space I've never visited, to think what I do not know how to think. My understanding of art is informed by phenomenology and objects and people defining themselves over and over again by their relationships. To be worked by this session I think would allow me to approach my work with a much more delicate approach to the spaces of ambiguity in my work.###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead.

And then I would build, with the help of everyone there, houses in the trees while we stand on the wires and platforms of the ropes course.

I came across the program in December, but hadn't checked back for a deadline. I thought I should try for a spot anyway.   I am a passionate, curious artist, who likes to occupy and agitate the background. I graduate from York University in 2012 with a BFA in Visual Art and Psychology. I'm currently working on my MA in Art History at York University. I work in performance, sound, video and multiples to explore magic and queerness. I volunteer at an LGBTQ youth service in the city and regularly attend community education sessions. I try to find creative and nurturing ways to build my community, without falling adhering to dogmas and (sometimes limiting) tropes. I try to be aware of my energy, the space I find myself in and those around me (or not).###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)I would describe my creative/intellectual practice as mischievous. I like to slip around things and circle them. I think that humour is an important part of my practice, which is inherently social. Apart from it's communicative nature, humour is the unexpected tipping point between the ludacris and the grotesque. Play with affective poles is central to my work. My sense of humour is used to side-eye rational and/or hegemonic processes. I hope that my work creates moments of confusion and discomfort, which I feel are fertile spaces for growth and understanding.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)I was a part of a group show in 2011 called Ululology. The show was a quasi-response to the Occupy Movement, which was quite active at that time. Myself and five other sound artists worked independently on projects and periodically shared our progress with one another. At the end of a few weeks, our work was placed in the same gallery space. None of the works were made for headphones, so the possibility of being heard was constantly negotiated. The volumes were altered daily to create different relationships and reconstruct the space. My project was an extremely loud, deep bass piece which vibrated the only seating in the room, and a sound track of shaking tea sets.###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)I aspire to live in a communal home in the future but have not been able to as of yet. I've stayed in hostels on a number of occasions for majority of my travelling, the longest being a 14 day stay in Vancouver. I feel that I can successfully read the room and respect the needs of those around me. I prefer to share space with others and have never had any issues with listening and communication or sharing responsibilities. I am a very clean and hardworking housemate.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)"The poles of nature and culture are present in both my art practice and my research. My explorations of the supernatural always return to the laws of nature, religious institutions, essence and the body. How can something exist outside of nature if nature is all encompassing? What does it mean for something to be alive or not? In what ways is History, that is to say the forward facing path of civilization, distinct from muscle memory and memory in general?   For my MA research, I analyze the dissemination of an urban, self-identified ""half-breed"" indigenous filmmaker named Ariel Smith. Her videos question naivety and gender performances. I am using the trickster figure as a framework for her artistic practice and the sneaky, somewhat non-human characters in her work.   Also, I feel that the living experience itself will be a part of processing the theme. I am very excited to have the opportunity to express myself and learn from others in a communal environment."###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead.

I want to bring these together, to explore Edge Habitat, using wilderness as a metaphor for what we have lost as a civilization, and what we grieve as individuals.###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)I am beginning to conceive of a consortium of people, living and working around the world, who in their own ways, are working to bridge the gap between civilization (and all the domestications that come with that) and wildness. This gap exists between ourselves and our darkest parts, between ourselves and others, between past and future (in the absence of presence), and between domesticated and wild, so anyone who is engaged in exploring this gap is necessarily a part of the movement towards healing.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)I don't have any examples of art work.

It is the only way to live! During our intensive training periods at Zen Mountain Monastery, we engage in body practice, which is... Ultimate Frisbee! When I arrived at ZMM, I had never played frisbee, and had never played it in a group, on a team, in silence! Unfortunately, I think it is the truth that before this game, I have never done an activity simply because it is fun, and, even as I worked hard to stay in silence, I found myself laughing wildly throughout the hour each week. We are all competitive to varying degrees, and we all work hard to score goals, but no points are tallied. We practice letting it go the moment it is over. It feels clean, and full of joy. It is a phenomenal manifestation of Indra's net, an active form of communal engagement, a wildly dynamic illustration of live interconnectedness, of causal relations, of loving inclusion and the healthy channeling of aggression, of multiplicity, and active quick attentiveness.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)The project I am tip-toeing towards will be based in the effort to close the gap between civilization and wildness, between solar consciousness and lunar consciousness. I want to offer, along with others who are doing similarly-oriented work around the world, wilderness rites of passage, wherein those of us who feel like we've lost our way, can begin to find our way back. The theme of the session, between culture and wildness, is well-suited to the work that I am beginning to step into, though the word 'culture' definitely throws a different light on to what I am calling civilization. However, this dissonance has the potential for much juicy exploration, which I would love to engage with the support and challenge of others.###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead.

(200 word limit)I would facilitate a dream council, or a visionary council, or a 24hr solo fast, with mirroring and a communal setting of intentions.  Dream councils involve the setting of sacred space, and the creation of a communal matrix using dream time. Visioning councils are circles, facilitated with a theme in mind, allowing the community to enter into shared shikantaza, which is a zen term for open awareness. We will form a container which is strong enough to hold all voices, as the sky is vast enough to allow all forms of weather to move through. The solo is an opportunity to go out into the wilderness with just water and a simple shelter. No journal. No food. Bare bones. Just you and the mirror of the wild. There is council before, to clarify intentions, and council after, to mirror and listen to stories. And in the middle, during the Threshold, we are all invisible, and in the spirit world, wandering until we each find our own unique power spots. There we stay, sitting vigil overnight, watching for what the mind, both internal and external, has to offer.###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)What is your life question? I am in the middle. I struggle with the gaps. A deep part of me wants only to retreat, to fall into silence, to cease the movement, and to listen, watch. And a powerful part of me wants to run, to involve myself, to create. I feel I am on the edge of a process of constant breaking down/building up, and I can commit to neither one nor the other.

I'm from Knoxville, TN but I see myself as a man of the world. I have always loved and welcomed change and new challenges, which definietely plays apart of my artistic practice. I have traveled to China 7 times now, traveling over there took a large part of my life as a child. Growing up understanding two completely different cultures and walks of life has given me a drive and intense will to work and produce art that challenges and awakens us to this existence.###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)My process is very open. I work with whatever is around me I have always been very flexible, I don't see divisions between different art practices and or social practice. One of my biggest interests has been film/video which it in itslef is very collaborative. Most of my work or practice is about asking questions, in this sense asking is also a collaborative process.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)I collaborated with the band Yung Life by choreographing and performing a dance/performance in lieu of their music. We toured across the east coast for three weeks performing in public spaces. As the tour continued my choreography transformed because of our newfound experiences and interactions. My work is reactionary and very open to the environment around me.###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)Lived with 5 people in a van in July across East Coast. I am currently living with 21 people in a apartment in Midtown turned illegal bunk bed scenario. Backpacked across China for 2 months living with people I met paying dues by helping around and through art gifts.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)"I thoroughly enjoyed Deleuze and Guattari's ""Precept, Affect, and Concept"" I'm very interested in how Deleuze's concept's can be implemented in an actual practice.  I love how explorative the program seems. Creating a residency that challenges what a regular residency is very interesting to me. After my stay in New York I have realized that I must shut myself in or at least be in a place more secluded. Where I can reconnect to the actual world. This line from The Tao Te Ching has been stuck in my head.  ""You don't have to leave your room to understand what's happening in the world. You don't have to look out the window to appreciate the beauty of heaven. The farther you go  the less you know.  Using this: Sages don't go anywhere and yet know what to do.  Don't see and yet name things.  Don't deem-act and yet accomplish."###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)The beginning of my series of sculptures around the country creating objects of ritual or importance for the American landscape. Sculptures that are extremely permanent, and with time become culturally relevant. Stupa like sculptures that people have to trek on foot to experience. Or an interactive performance that utilizes parts of the forest that one has to travel to one part play/open conversation and surreal performance. Putting viewers into a state of acute awareness of the world around them.###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)why do we always try to find answers? Why do we think our answers divulge some kind of truth? Answers only lead to more questions. Hopefully one realizes that truth isn't within the answer, it is in asking the better question. For truth exists in the human act, the process of finding. The journey.###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summer###How did you hear about SMT?from a nice guy at a party who gave me your card.###What sorts of foods do you not eat?

In college, I studied philosophy at the University of Chicago – a school I wanted to go to because of their core curriculum (with classes like 'Self, Culture, & Society') and their “UNcommon Application”. I said in my uncommon application that I thought a liberal arts education would make me a better thinker and therefore a better artist. That was when I was 18. Now I'm 30.   I moved to NYC after college to pursue acting. I worked with an experimental theater company called the Bats at the acclaimed Flea Theater and in the NYC Fringe Festival. I learned a lot about working on new plays. Eventually, I realized that training was essential to my craft, and in 2012, I got my MFA in acting at Rutgers. Since Rutgers, I've been honing my skills working in off-Broadway and regional theater, film, and national commercials. I am always dedicated to taking my work to the next level.   I find inspiration in a diversity of interests. Currently, I'm working on a line of recycled denim clothing and accessories called SilkDenim, a screenplay, and I'm learning how to make films with a DSLR. I'm also engaged in feminist art. For example, last year I was a guest speaker in a high school girls' health class to discuss body image and feminist issues for which I created a questionnaire and inspirational handout. I love using art to explore the world, and I don't feel the need to limit that to one medium. All types of art inform my ability to be engaged with my surroundings and question assumptions I have about myself and the world. For I believe “the unexamined life is not worth living.”###In what ways is your creative/intellectual practice collaborative? (300 word limit)Finding a balance between individual and collaborative work is an essential part of my creative path. Luckily, acting has taught me a lot about it. Despite being fundamentally collaborative, acting has a very solid basis of independent work that makes me aware of the difference between them and the necessity of both. When I walk into rehearsal or show up to perform, hours of personal preparation and body conditioning are involved. But all that preparation is really just that, because it is through collaboration that magic happens. Collaborating in the theater happens on many levels with many different people - the director, castmates, audiences, designers...on big and small levels, from creating the mood of the piece to deciding where to place a chair. My collaboration with the costume designer is different from my collaboration with an audience. I feel sometimes my collaboration with the audience is the most beautiful, but then I remember that it wouldn’t be possible without many other collaborations. Each play I do, I rediscover the awe of just how collaborative the theater is. Everyone has their own job, but all the jobs have to come together into a nightly experience for a short time. It's a challenge, but when it works, a true sense of community is created, and it feels awesome.   My orientation to the world as an artist is by its very nature collaborative. I'm currently collaborating with my Mom on SilkDenim, I'm writing that screenplay with a friend, and I'm working on auditions in classes. I always find ways to engage others in projects. I find that collaborating with others keeps me motivated, structured, and challenged. In a sense, everything I do is collaborative. I love collaborating with friends and family, but I also love collaborating with a whole new group of people.###Provide an example of at least one past work or project that best represents you as an artist/thinker fit for our program (300 word limit)The last play I did was Parlour Song by Jez Butterworth, a British contemporary dark comedy about 3 people trapped in a suburban mundane existence. I played Joy, a depressed and desperate housewife who begins stealing her husband's things to get his attention. Joy is a seemingly 'unlikeable' character; she steals, lies, and cheats to get what she wants. And Parlour Song is a highly poetic and at times absurd play. The combination proved to be a deeply fulfilling challenge for me, requiring me to be a more nuanced and patient performer.   Everyone involved in this production was a truly committed, talented, and giving artist. The play itself was brilliant material. Audiences were open and engaged. As a result of all these wonderful collaborations mixed with my hard individual work, I learned to embrace a part of me that really brought Joy to life. And this process of learning to bring Joy to life got deeper and deeper each and every night, with every show, every talkback, and every kitchen table conversation.  Through hard work and collaboration, I saw and felt the underlying humanity in Joy and the true depth of Parlour Song. This best represents me as an artist fit for your program because it not only shows me as a successful working professional, but as one who, when put into an engaged and critical community, excels and thrives. It can't exactly be shown to you because you would have had to see the play, but it helps that we received good press. Parlour Song proved to me that I'm a skilled artist who never stops learning, who puts her entire self into her work, and who works well with others.   Parlour Song reviews:  [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yksRx98QR3s](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yksRx98QR3s) [http://thetartan.org/2013/11/4/pillbox/parloursong](http://thetartan.org/2013/11/4/pillbox/parloursong)  Pgh Post Gazette named me one of the best actresses of the year for my performance:  [http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2014/01/05/Daina-Michelle-Griffith-2013-Performer-of-the-Year/stories/201401050053](http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2014/01/05/Daina-Michelle-Griffith-2013-Performer-of-the-Year/stories/201401050053)###Please describe a communal living experience you’ve had (200 word limit)Once a year, a group of friends get together at my friend's Dad's house on Long Island. I call it my heaven. We make all our food together, we hang out on the rocky beach, we have long discussions about our lives and the future, we go for swims, walks, trips to buy food or pick people up, we collect and play with rocks. We clean up together. We spend time on everyone. We also respect when people want to be on their own and read or just be alone, take an outdoor shower. We build fires on the beach, and I always insist we roast marshmallows. We swim to the neighbor's floating trampoline and try to bounce each other off. This is heaven to me.  I've lived in a lot of different set-ups, but most recently it's either been alone or with my boyfriend. I love living alone, but I often wonder if I had more time in a large communal house setting, would I be more inspired to think outside the box when it comes to my art.###Please explain how the session structure/class/theme you are applying to will aid your development as an artist/thinker (300 word limit)The question 'how can we think what we do not know how to think?' intrigues me because it reflects a kind of questioning I have about my creativity and life. I guess you could say I'm always thinking about how I think about things in the hopes that I'll teach myself how to better think about things. When you define thinking as “a questioning and investigating of the basic assumptions that define our selves, culture and world,” I get very exited. I have a little fire within me that is never satisfied with the first idea, or with things as they are. I find that to be a natural state for me as an artist and a thinker, but also one that needs attention and effort, because it is in this state that I begin to truly create new ideas.   I think your program would encourage me take my creative investigation to the next level, and I'm looking to do so. What your school offers sounds particularly well-suited for me, because we have a mutual appreciation for the connection between the intellectual and the creative and for exploring innovative forms of learning. I like to talk but I also like to move, use my body, and try new things. For example, the extremely physical portion of the Unthinking/Unknowing session sounds really cool to me. I believe your approach may help me at this stage of my life and career, where I have a good foundation of skill and experience, but I've got something new I'm broaching that I need to get out.###Given the structure of the hike this summer, describe a workshop or immersive lecture you may want to lead. (200 word limit)###Given unlimited funding, describe a project you could envision mounting at an SMT session. (200 word limit)I would mount a 1-woman show based on the themes discussed in school in relation to themes I am working on as a feminist artist. I would come to the program already prepared with 5 female characters I want to explore. They would be a range of women in age and race, and I would use my time to create a show with these characters. I think with an unlimited budget, I would also bring in video and sound to make it a multi-media piece. I would start writing monologues and performing them for feedback the first week. The second week I would form the story, and the final days would be used to mount the show. I would want to bring in themes of beauty and body-mage, but mostly I would want to explore the ways in which different women grapple with their own self-worth.###Please write your own question and answer it (100 word limit)What is a theme you explore in your art?  Like with Parlour Song, I explore making the despicable relatable. It's not only necessary for acting, but also for communicating with others, and it requires admitting your own faults and trying to see the good in others' faults. More than empathy, it's about better understanding human behavior, or 'bad' behavior. It's easy to designate things good or bad, but when I look from an artistic point of view, I'm forced to see new perspectives. I'm forced to re-imagine and personalize a negative stereotype in hopes of getting others to see that stereotype in themselves or in ways they hadn’t before.###Please describe any potential scheduling conflicts for this summerN/a###How did you hear about SMT?A Facebook post by Josephine Decker###What sorts of foods do you not eat?
