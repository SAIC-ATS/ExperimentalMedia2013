Hey, I'm Michael Fox. I'm from Bowling Green, Ohio.

~~I like~~
I love to learn about theoretical physics and like to explore concepts 
that relate to this in my artwork. There is a vast expanse of 
philosophical possibilities that arrive with the knowledge of some of 
these modern theories.

Creative coding has become a very influential part of my art making but 
I also prefer having a physical object or structure to bridge the gap 
between physical and virtual.
